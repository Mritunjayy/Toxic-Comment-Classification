While any edit warring may lead to sanctions, there is a bright-line rule called the three-revert rule (3RR), the violation of which often leads to a BLOCK.The three-revert rule states:An editor must not perform more than three reverts on a single page—whether involving the same or different material—within a 24-hour period. An edit or a series of consecutive edits that undoes other editors' actions—whether in whole or in part—counts as a revert. Violations of the rule normally attract BLOCKS of at least 24 hours. Any appearance of gaming the system by reverting a fourth time just outside the 24-hour slot is likely to be treated as an edit-warring violation. See below for exemptions.A """"page"""" means any page on Wikipedia, including talk and project space. A """"revert"""" means any edit (or administrative action) that reverses the actions of other editors, in whole or in part, whether involving the same or different material. A series of consecutive saved revert edits by one user with no intervening edits by another user counts as one revert.The three-revert rule applies per person, not per account; reverts made by multiple accounts operated by one editor count together. Editors violating 3RR will usually be BLOCKED for 24 hours for a first incident. Even without a 3RR violation, an administrator may still act if they believe a user's behavior constitutes edit warring, and any user may report edit warring with or without 3RR being breached. The rule is not an entitlement to revert a page a specific number of times.
If an editor violates 3RR by mistake, they should reverse their own most recent reversion. Administrators may take this into account and decide not to BLOCK in such cases—for example if the user is not a habitual edit warrior and is genuinely trying to rectify their own mistake.""""

Note. With the following sources:

 
 
 

I have expanded the name section.

Even with the new information about whether SJP has an apostrophe or an extra s, the only way the 'dab page for similar names' idea makes any sense, is if you make every similar name without a target:

 St. James Park
 St James' Park
 St. James' Park
 St James's Park
 Saint James Park
 Saint James' Park
 Saint James's Park

all point to the 'home dab page', St James Park, with outgoing links to the articles:

 St. James's Park (the primary topic, the london park)
 St James' Park, Newcastle
 St James' Park, Bristol (article setion pipe link)
 St James Park, Exeter

I still think this is pretty poor solution, when there are no direct conflicts between the actual article names used. I frankly don't see how it is any better than when the articles had dab hats to cater for people who either mispelled links or mis-spelled in the search box. The only advantage to adding (, Newcastle) to the title is for pre-emptive assistance to user navigation in the search box, so in that case, a redirect variation for London, Newcastle, Exeter needs to be created for all similar names that a user might type into the search box, namely:

 St James Park
 St. James Park
 St James' Park
 St. James' Park
 St James's Park 
 St. James's Park
 Saint James Park
 Saint James' Park
 Saint James's Park

meaning that:

 St James Park, Newcastle
 St. James Park, Newcastle
 St James' Park, Newcastle
 St. James' Park, Newcastle
 St James's Park, Newcastle
 St. James's Park, Newcastle
 Saint James Park, Newcastle
 Saint James' Park, Newcastle
 Saint James's Park, Newcastle

should all redirect to St James' Park, Newcastle as the current name

I will do that now as it seems a good idea anyway, whether this article stays with """" ,Newcastle"""" added to the title or not. 

The disambiguators with (brackets) are against policy, as geographic disambiguation is done by commas to the next highest administrative sub-division, so these should be deleted.

P.S. None of this even addresses what to do with the potential mis-spellings of
 St Jame's Park
 St. Jame's Park

wikipedia's censorship

I looked up Bash Back (The sodomite terrorist group that attacked the Church in Michigan) on wikipedia  (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_Back) just to see what liberal bias they would have. Under the section """"Antifascist action at 2008 Milwaukee Pridefest"""" Wakopedia says """"In response, Bash Back! Milwaukee planned a confrontation of the hate group."""" the """"hate group they are talking about is the NAZIs but then if the NAZIs are a hate group then Bash back must also be a hate group so I edited it to say """"In response, The hate group Bash Back! Milwaukee planned a confrontation of the hate group.""""

Since they also didn't have any topic for the new terrorist attack on the church I added a few lines & was attacked by the Admins. So they added the following paragraph
2008 Disruption at Mt. Hope Church in Lansing, MI

Bash Back! members disrupted a Sunday sermon at Mt. Hope Church in Lansing, Michigan on November 9th, 2008. They dropped a banner in the church, threw thousands of fliers, made out in front of the congregation, yelled """"Jesus was a Homo"""", pulled the fire alarm and initiated pro-gay chants. Mt. Hope is an Assemblies of God church which holds and promotes """"ex-gay"""" events and preaches that homosexuality is a sin.

I edited the first line of the paragraph to read """"Christaphobic Bash Back! members disrupted.... & added the following footnote 

""""Christphobia (from Greek Christós: Messiah; phóbos: fear, phobia) is an irrational fear of, aversion to, or discrimination against Christianity.""""

I took the defanition word for wors from Wakopedia's definition for Homophobia & just changed the Homo/Christos & Homo/ Christian parts.

For this I received the following note from the admin

This is the last warning you will receive for your disruptive edits, such as those you made to Bash Back. If you vandalize Wikipedia again, you will be blocked from editing. Please maintain a neutral point of view. ukexpat (talk)

I have no concerns about his edit, but it is unsourced. I trust this guy, but we may have to wait until his Encyclopedia about Galliformes comes out and totally revises the taxonomy. Pinudjem is his second part of his middle name (Amoun-Pinudjem) of his alternate name (Milad Sourial). If you search for that name on the web you can see that he is making a movie called """"Goddess of the Sun"""", not only from the photo gallery concerning the Green Peafowl but also from a site not by him.

Kermit does not have a real name. His real parents gave him a name he didn't like. Sadly, his real parents died in a political assacination. He was then named Kermit Roosevelt by his adoptive parents, but he didn't like that either. He has three user accounts: User:Amoun-Pinudgem (middle name), User:Milad A.P. Sourial, and his newest is User:Pinudjem. However, he has also edited with an IP once, which was reverted. He often writes under Kermit Blackwood and was also quoted in the Red Data Book as K. B. Woods (who suggested that Greens are monogamous and possible Yunnan subspecies).

He is a writer on the Feathersite, a site that talks about poultry, wild ducks and gamebirds, etc.

One must know that Kermit is not sure that the Green Peafowl is a superspecies complex, but that he created that hypothesis, and that he believes the best way to know the truth is to try and disprove it. However, preliminary data confirms his hypothesis of multiple species. He has already collected tissue samples and compared them but he believes it is better if nuclear DNA can also be extracted from samples.

Wolfgang Mennig, a breeder who suggests that there are additional subspecies (not species), also confirms (he e-mailed me) that he is friends with Kermit and that they try to work together as much as possible.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Formed in 1878, Everton were founder members of The Football League in 1888 and [avoid """"and's"""", very amateurish] won their first [avoid """"their"""", very amateurish] league championship three years later. [date of formation and winning not connected, should be in separate paras] Following five league titles and two FA Cups, Everton experienced a lull in the post-war period until a revival in the 1960s, winning two league championships and an FA Cup. The mid-1980s represented their [avoid """"their"""", very amateurish] most recent period of success, with two league victories, an FA Cup, and the 1985 European Cup Winners' Cup—their first continental trophy. The club's most recent major trophy was the 1995 FA Cup.

The club have a large fanbase and regularly attracts high attendances, averaging over 36,000, 90% of stadium capacity.[2] Everton have a notable rivalry with neighbours Liverpool F.C. and matches between the two sides are known as the Merseyside Derby. Liverpool F.C. were formed in 1892 by a breakaway group consisting of Everton's former president and several players. The dispute also resulted in Everton leaving Anfield, their original home ground.

This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. 

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

For guidelines on specific types of articles, you may want to check out our criteria for biographies, for web sites, for bands, or for companies. Feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this.   
 
 You should wait for others to write an article about subjects in which you are personally involved. This applies to articles about you, your achievements, your band, your business, your publications, your website, your relatives, and any other possible conflict of interest. 

Creating an article about yourself is strongly discouraged. If you create such an article, it might be listed on articles for deletion. Deletion is not certain, but many feel strongly that you should not start articles about yourself. This is because independent creation encourages independent validation of both significance and verifiability. All edits to articles must conform to Wikipedia:No original research, Wikipedia:Neutral point of view, and Wikipedia:Verifiability. 

If you are not """"notable"""" under Wikipedia guidelines, creating an article about yourself may violate the policy that Wikipedia is not a personal webspace provider and would thus qualify for speedy deletion.

 Filipacchi """"emigrant"""" category issue 

This is a tricky and interesting matter of definition, which I've been discuss with Obi-Wan Kenobi. We decided to move it over here.  Filipacchi is currently in the category of """"French emigrants to the United States."""" But is Filipachi an """"emigrant""""? Given that she was an American citizen at birth (because of her mother's American citizenship).

Hope it's okay to print our discussion as a dialogue. (Certainly it's dramatic...)

ME: Here's the legal definition of """"immigrant"""" (and emigrant is just the inverse, of course):

""""An Immigrant is a person who has citizenship in one country but who enters a different country to set up a permanent residence. Just entering another country does not make you an immigrant. In order to be an immigrant you must have citizenship in one country, and you must have gone to a different country with the specific intention of living there.""""

It seems clear that Filipacchi does not qualify as an immigrant, since she already had citizenship. For this reason she can't be an emigrant either.

Agreed? I don't want to revert your edit myself - as it looks like an editing war; I'll leave it to you to do the reversion, if we're in accord here. 

OBI-WAN-KENOBI: I don't think emigrant is a legal term in our category structure - it really is more about what happened. She grew up in paris, speaking french, and then moved, leaving paris behind, for NY. I think calling that emigrant is fair - regardless of citizenship status.
emigrant: """"a person who leaves one place or country, esp a native country, to settle in another """" Also, you can be an immigrant and an emigrant at the same time - it's really a question of perspective. 

ME: Yes, you in fact HAVE to be an immigrant and an emigrant at the same time. You can't be one or the other. Hence the definition of """"immigrant"""" is all that matters. My problem is that to call Filipacchi an """"emigrant"""" is in fact *incorrect*, looked at from the perspective of the US government. It doesn't have to be a legal matter - I'm simply regarding this as the most rigorous definition that we have. This is taken from a legal site that advises UK citizens on how to emigrate to America:

""""The US government considers an immigrant to be someone who is not a US citizen, but who has received clearance to permanently reside in the US.""""
http://www.immigrationassist.co.uk/immigration/us-immigration/ 

What this suggests is that it is logically impossible to emigrate to the US if you are already a US citizen. 

OBI-WAN-KENOBI: Emigrant doesn't have the same legal definition - and it arguably applies, because """"france"""" was just as much """"her country"""" as the US is. we'd probably best bring this to her talk page in any case.

That's where it stands now. Currently she is in the emigrant category.  Thoughts?   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Hello, I'm David. Although I created this account in July 2008, I've been familiar with Wikipedia since October 2006. I've been visiting for several years, but it was nearly April 2011 that I started contributing seriously. Contributions on Commons Wikimedia.

I've participated with anything from: looking for sources, cleaning vandalism, articles for deletion discussion, newpages patrol, recent changes patrol, removing old IP warnings and random article patrol. If users have questions, I'll attempt my best to answer them. This user is being considered for deletion, you can voice your opinion(s) at User:GlassCobra/Editor for deletion.

The tags serve a useful purpose, even after the article is brought to AfD, and especially so when they have been on the article for a significant length of time. They make it clear to visiting editors that any interested parties have had a fair chance to improve the article, and hadn't, which is often a point used in support of deletion. Conversely, if the article isn't tagged, it's not clear that interested parties have been given a chance to improve the article, which may be used to support a keep argument. Removing the tag makes the status either way less clear. Yes, it's available in the history, but why make editors go through the extra work of checking the history? In addition, an AfD can end without reaching a consensus, which means the tag most likely still applies and would have to be restored. No, the time to remove the tag is after a consensus has been reached at the AfD that the subject does meet the notability guidelines, i.e. after it is closed with result keep (or in some cases, when the eventual outcome is clear per WP:SNOW).

 help with course of action concerning possible infringement 

Hello Kevin!

It's evening here in Romania and I'm back on WP. Thanks for your offer to help.
Here's the story in a nutshell:
I went to school with a famous sportsperson and multiple Olympic champion and she's still a rather close friend. Needless to say none of the existing WP articles about her were written by me because, despite the notability being out of question, I felt I couldn't be objective. But those articles exist.
Yesterday she brought to my attention that a book was published in the States,(apparently in 2010) containing her biography and with the statement  on the cover that it was """"based on high quality Wikipedia articles"""". She says that, according to what she was told, it sells on Amazon for 50 USD/48 EUR and that she would send me a link from the Barnes&Noble; website. There are several issues here: first, both she and I don't think it's ethical to publish any kind of biography of a living person without notifying the person (and at least her business address is widely known). Secondly, and which has to do directly with Wikipedia, both she and I don't believe that one can, just like that, copy &paste; content that is made available for free and make profit out of it (how much of this book did the authors actually work for? we don't know, because we don't have it yet; but they take pride in """"basing"""" it on wp which  is not a good sign).

OK, I tried to read my way through the terms of use pages, read about the new terms of use, too (although probably they shouldn't apply retroactively) but I couldn't get a clear picture of what applies here and what can be done. I'll come back with the link when I get it. Thanks again   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Which """"some works"""" for ten-string guitar? As far as Mel Bay's catalogue is concerned, Marlow has one little piece """"Of the Sea"""" in an anthology (not edited by her and not for 10-string guitar, ISBN: 0786674563), and some arrangements for flute and SIX-string guitar of easy/light classics (ISBN: 078664687X). This is hardly anything to base a claim on of someone being an authority on the TEN-string guitar. Also, anyone with musical knowledge can compare the quality of my own editions on my site and those by Janet Marlow and see who is the authority.

Anyway, I have the support of Fritz Buss, who studied with Yepes between 1960 and 1986 and whom Yepes considered """"an excellent guitarist with a wonderful technique but also a deep musician aware of his responsibility and always in search of more knowledge and perfection"""" as well as considering Buss one of the three best guitar teachers in the word . And Fritz Buss has written that """"Viktor van Niekerk is a conscious artist with a total understanding of the ten-string guitar as envisioned by Narciso Yepes."""" And I have the autographed documents to prove it. So, Andrew, if you have something constructive (some actual knowledge) to contibute, then please do so.

I'm sorry to say, but you're totally off base. I'll take it that you haven't followed the sequence of events and are totally unaware of who edited what. If you would have checked out the exact sequence of events you couldn't have come to such conclusions and made such comments.

Frankly, I am very disappointed in you trying to equate us. While my reputation is unblemished and everyone who has followed me here knows that I'm here to add my knowledge on Jewish subjects for which I have barely scratched the surface, and although I am bold,  I go out of my way to be fair and uphold the neutrality of Wikipedia. Tiamut on the other hand has one agenda, and one agenda only; to push a Palestinian POV. I'm sorry to say, but your trying to put her in a good light rings hollow. Please check out what many other editors have said about her and then tell me if you still think so. Sorry I cannot sit back and watch you trying to equate us. By equating us you are actually smearing my character and exonerating her which is really not fair. It seems to me that she cannot do any bad and I cannot do very much good; that's the impression I get from your comments.

Here are some things you say which I find incorrect or disturbing. The reason I am calm is because I have given up on her, given up on the mediators, and almost given up on Wikipedia. Only people who think that they can win or accomplish something are passionate in what they do. I'll talk straight and pull no punches. I made my comment on your page only to show you that Tiamut is lying, in the belief that maybe you’ll open your eyes. Tiamut hasn't gotten under my skin at all; I know what she is up to and want to stop it; but if you (not you necessarily) will try to stop me instead of her, then I'll bid all of you good bye and let you have what you deserve. I have no softer way of putting it, that I just can't take this crap that Tiamut thought it reasonable to add """"nation"""" to the opening paragraph. No, she knows exactly what she is doing and such comments are what lets her get away with it. While Tiamut has lost her temper many times; I haven't lost my temper even once; disappointed, yes; lost temper, no. You say that you're surprised that Tiamut didn't go to the talk page earlier; I wonder why you're surprised; don't you see that she first tries to get away with whatever she can, then she'll engage in talk with no intention of compromising but to get part of her pushing accepted and put off the rest for another round. You say that I started my conversation with a negative touch by its heading of POV pushing. My purpose is not anymore to set her straight, which I have already given up. My purpose is to point out her POV pushing to all of you. Actually I think that I'm treating her with kid gloves compared to how administrators would have dealt with her, if they only wanted to. Lastly I completely object to your equating us both as edit warring. When one side explains, but the other side says one thing on the talk page and does something else on the article; then the explainer shouldn't be labeled an edit warier simply to be able to play the equation game. Please get it straight; I am an honest editor and she is a POV pusher, and the twain doesn't meet. She needs to be admonished not mediated; you cannot mediate with someone who will only play the game of mediation with no intention of good faith editing.

Her response to you is a game which allows her to do what she wants while she is engages in dilly-dallying and in false placation. Tiamut has learned to play a game with all of you. She pretends to engage in discussion but in reality does what she wants and then has the audacity to reverse the sequence of events to make it look as if she thought she was doing the right thing. Now watch her threaten that she will report me; that's also part of her game, and if she succeeds then Wikipedia doesn’t deserve any better.   

It's time to call a spade a spade; because otherwise Wikipedia will lose its valuable editors and stay with the crap. I’m really fed up with Wikipedia, and ready to bid everyone farewell.

I agree with George Profulis, a respected local meterologist. New Jersey is hit by a Category 1 or 2 storm directly (landfall) about once every 100 years (last in 1903, putting us 6 years overdue), and by a Category 3 or 4 landfalling storm every 200 years (last 1821, 188 years ago, coming due soon). Major storms passing within 50 miles off our coast ('38, '44, Donna, Belle, Gloria) causing a """"direct hit"""" are far more common, and can be just as damaging and deadly. I would say that a repeat of '44 today, would cause Katrina-like damage in the Northeast. New Jersey might be small, but it is also the most densely populated state in the nation. Many of the homes, especially those along the shore, are only a few feet apart.  A good storm surge like seen in '44 would devastate 100 miles of prime real estate that is far more valuable per square mile then that along the Gulf Coast. Also, strong storms passing to our west (Gale of 1878, Tropical Storm David in 1979) can put N.J. in a storm's right front quadrant, the most vicious part of the cyclone""",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Non-Authority Professor Samuel Eliot Morison 
To some writers this marriage appears to be a great mystery. How could a foreign chartmaker [NOTE: suddenly he is a chartmaker and not the same """"LANERIO DE JANUA"""" wool weaver of Genoa presented in the Raccolta document XXXXI from 1472, Morison, going against the documents promoted the wool-weaver to a chartmaker? ] of low birth who had been literally “on the beach” a few years before, marry into one of the noble families of the kingdom? Already about 25 years old when she caught young Christopher’s roving eye, her mother was glad enough to have no more convent bills to pay, and as son-in-law to secure an up-and-coming young man of gentlemanly manners, who asked for no dowry. ( Samuel Eliot Morison, Admiral of the Ocean Sea (Little, Brown, Boston, 1942).)
THIS previous extract IS A FANTASY INVENTED By MORISON AND A BIG LIE- This is a fabrication by Morison written completely without any proof. Morison did not find anything related to FIlipa's dowry AND the truth is that Filipa’s mother was NOT paying any “convent bills” because Filipa was so privilegded that she lived at the Monastery of Santos belonging to the elite Military Order of Santiago where she had ALL EXPENSES PAID, as a """"Comendadora"""" just like her cousin ANA de MENDONÇA (King John II's Mistress) and her aunt VIOLANTE NOGUEIRA (nanny of King John II's aunts) and even participated in the management of the All-Saints """"Comendary"""". Morison even invented that his “Colombo peasant” was an up-and-coming star, a prodigy as if the mother-in-law, Isabel Moniz, already knew in 1478, only 2 years after supposedly washing ashore penniless (and not able to speak Portuguese or even Italian) that the wool-weaver was going to be a famous STAR in 1493. FURTHERMORE: Filipa's marriage in 1479 HAD to be AUTHORIZED by King John II who was MASTER of the Comendadoras of Santiago. Contrary to what Morison and his supporters of the wool-weaver tale wrote of this fantasy marriage, it was impossible for Filipa Moniz to have married a non-noble two-bit weaver the likes of that Genoese Colombo who had supposedly washed ashore only two years prior from parts unknown with no money, no education, no ship nor even a job in that closed high-class society of Portugal—a noble society so restricted that the Captain of Madeira actually arrested his brother's noble widow for marrying a Nobleman below her station.(1) There is NO DOUBT that Filipa’s husband had to be her equal in social stature and not any wool-weaver. The whole tale invented by Morison of a peasant marrying a Noble Portuguese Captain’s daughter is a perfect example of how inaccurate have been the history books on the history of Admiral Cristóbal Colón.
The motivations that bring an author to take such wild liberties with the truth are not intended to be dealt with in this book, however it is something that should alarm all readers because the established pattern had always been one of accepting the """"myth of the Genoese weaver"""" and then twisting the known facts to fit into that tale while at the same time discarding important facts that deny a peasant birth for the discoverer..... Don Fernando Colón who wrote that his father was of noble lineage and not a peasant laborer form anywhere as others were: """"Falsely calling him a craftsman ... [as such the Admiral] would not have learned so many letters or sciences ... especially the four main sciences ... Astrology, Cosmography, Geometry and Navigation ... The admiral was a man of letters and of great experience, and did not spend time on things manual or on mechanical arts.(2) Today's investigations and scientific research confirms that Don Fernando Colón was right and that his father could never have been the wool-weaver Colombo, or Pigeon but was instead a Kõlon, or Member of some special noble family.""""

Just to correct you, in america, hispanic and anglo are used as racial terms. Where do you come from that you don't recognize this? Again, just fo the record, europeans view non-white south americans as hispanic. Spaniards are not considered hispanic by european standards. 

And don't let these stupid americans fool you either! At one point, they considered jews and irish to be non-white, believe it or not. So, this speaks volumes of the ignorance of americans who don't even come close to europeans in culture, arts, language, science, fashion, etc.

If you disliked the way it's written now, you should see what it said before I changed it.  And just removing the citation (which I spent quite some time finding) is not very helpful.  Anyway, other than my slightly bruised ego, your point about the citation not mentioning ETH is well taken.  Regardless of terminology they distinctly were *not* talking about ETH but about UFOs.  I will try to change it to reflect that.  What the citation supports is the notion that when scientists review the evidence at hand, they conclude that some UFO reports merit further study, but they don't really comment much on ETH.  E.g. the notion that there's even a minority support for ETH in mainstream science is wrong.  And leaving the comment """"a few scientists ..."""" is zero info, since you can pretty much find a """"a few"""" scientists supporting any notion.  I will post a version of this comment on the ETH talk page; please follow up there if after my next edit you still disagree with the text.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Supercategories 

Hi Daniel

I just noticed on the Mariners article seems to have a couple of super-categories, Sport in NSW is a supercat of Football (soccer) in NSW, and Australian football (soccer) teams is a supercat of A-League teams.  It's a minor point but are the supercats necessary if you've already identified more specific cats?   
Ah, yes, you raise a very good point. I must say, categories have never been my strong point; the best example was Wikipedia:Featured list candidates/FIFA World Cup hat-tricks, when I submitted it to FLC without even adding them (I forgot about their existance totally).

Your inconsistent view points on references for cults and hate groups
In talk:cult you say that the checklists must go because they are unscientific, though they are clearly mentioned as disputed and attributed to the anti-cult movement. The one by Lifton is referenced. I support replacement of the other checklist by the one by Eileen Barker.  12:45, 3 Oct 2004 (UTC)
In talk:hate group you support a checklist presented as proven fact that is unattributed, but just made up and you oppose my view that the checklist must be referenced.  12:45, 3 Oct 2004 (UTC)

I may miss something but it seems that you use double standards to support your views. I hope that your can re-consider your opinions about references for checklists on these subjects. Thanks in advance.  12:39, 3 Oct 2004 (UTC)

Good point, Andries. I do not have a problem with these checklists if they are placed in the destructive cults article.  19:07, 3 Oct 2004 (UTC)
Zappaz, thanks for you changing your opinion. The problem is, I think, that it is difficult to distinguish between a harmless NRM, a cult and a destructive cult. That is why I think the checklists are important and should stay in the cult article, or at least directly linked to. I mean, my former group has some destructive/exploiting traits, which I only found out after nine years. Besides many scholars, the media and the public do not make the distinction between a cult and a destructive cult.  19:19, 3 Oct 2004 (UTC)

That is exactly the reason: the media and the public do not make that distinction. My hope is that the Wikipedia articles can throw some neutral light into that confusion. That is my hope. With your help and the help of other editors editing those articles, we have a good chance to suceed in doing that. And that would be a wonderful thing.  01:10, 4 Oct 2004 (UTC)

Regarding your complaints about Andries' behavior
May be it is because of my English but I think I was the co-author of the Criticism of Prem Rawat article. So were you. So was Jossi. I admit that Gary D was the main author. May be I am confused because of the subtle language differences between Dutch and Engish. Same for e.g. the word """"study"""" that has a slightly different meaning when compared to the Dutch word """"studie"""", which was, in hindsight, the reason for one of my many disputes with Jossi.  23:06, 10 Nov 2004 (UTC)

I only said on talk:past teachings of Prem Rawat that I do not understand you. In fact, I defended you against Jim's accusations.  23:06, 10 Nov 2004 (UTC)

I checked what I wrote on forum8 about you the last 60 days and I could only find the following post by me in which I defended you. http://www.forum8.org/forum8/posts/7621.html  23:06, 10 Nov 2004 (UTC)

I really do not understand why you think that my behavior towards you is inappropriate.  23:06, 10 Nov 2004 (UTC)

Zappaz, I think we have to concentrate on articles to prevent endless and senseless discussions. I do not think that we will ever agree about your complaints about my behavior.  01:26, 11 Nov 2004 (UTC)

I clearly see that you do not want to take responsibility for your actions. Fair enough.  05:35, 11 Nov 2004 (UTC)

Zappaz, I do take responsibility for my words. I write here under my real name and I even clarified my words outside Wikipedia upon your request here in Wikipedia. This is far more than the guidelines in Wikipedia or its spirit demand.  18:30, 12 Nov 2004 (UTC)

Besides, I did not make a cloaked accusation towards you. I had no other intention than to defend both Jim and you.  What can I do to convince you of that? In that post I explicitly wrote that I believed you to be sincere. It is not my fault that you go far beyond the literal meaning of what I wrote there and suspect that I made a cunning attack on your credibility. It took me even a while before I understood to what extent you had misinterpreted what I wrote.  18:30, 12 Nov 2004 (UTC)

Zappaz, I appreciate the information from Marc Galanter in the DLM article.  18:13, 18 Nov 2004 (UTC)

I did accidentally miss some text from my post and have now corrected it. I did not intend to say you were a BNP supporter. I noticed that you had edited the British National Party article recently and that was what I said, and which I stand by. I did not even look at your edit and even if I had I could not conclude or intend to say that you are a supporter of the BNP. If it was possible to read it that way, then I apologise. I have edited the remarks to make it make sense (I see now that it was incomplete). 
It is true that you and Steven Slater have edited the article about the BNP which is a tiny and insignificant extremist party in the UK. I did find it strange that two people who edit that article should descend and comment on the NPOV issue raised by Jesanj; especially when Jesanj has also mentioned in the past a claim that I did not understand at all until I googled the matter and it led me to a LaRouche organization website. I have no idea if he did get that comment from Larouche or invented it himself independently but this has aroused suspicion because the LaRouche organization seems to me to be an extreme political organization not at all unlike the BNP. There is also another connection I have found between Jesanj's edits and the LaRouche organization which for the time being I will not reveal publicly. Furthermore, an editor who was found to be a sock of a known LaRouche editor and who was apparently editing from a Larouche IP address was actively involved in supporting Jesanj in another edit dispute I have had with Jesanj. That user has now been blocked from editing WP. Here we have an editor (Jesanj) trying to justify that Palin was talking about NICE when there is no evidence for that. And now at NPONV we have a group of editors with editing connections to matters of extreme right wing / Nazi like organizations all seem to wish to see preserved in WP the same thing. An association, no matter how remote and unlikely between NICE and Death Panels. Jesanj also wants to connect NICE and the IPAB! Both are non mainstream (or extremist) views, which is why I keep removing his multiple attempts to add POV bias to WP. The combination of factors i describe is, I believe, a prima facia case for believing that there may not be any independence in the views being expressed by SOME of the editors who have commented on the NPOV issue. The simple fact is that Palin did not refer to NICE as a death panel and as far as we know, she did not even wish to imply that. She has had plenty of opportunity to clarify her comments and not once has she mentioned NICE. The position of the UK journalists is absurd because it has no foundation and as far as anyone can tell, so only an extremist would wish to support that view. To repeat it twice in different places when there is already a reference to NICE as a potential """"death panel"""" candidate in the article is taking liberties, and up with this we should not put. Which is why I deleted two of the references and left the third in.    """,0,0,0,0,0,0

This entry's game-plot/storyline is longer than the combined entries for the plot/storylines of all three movies.  A few hundred fans of the game may care about its story, but this sort of overly detailed plot exposition doesn't belong in a Wikipedia article.  Smells like fans trying to save a dying game.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  
I agree, though before seeing this section I was going to suggest splitting it off into a separate article to satisfy those who disagree. I think we need a little more discussion and consensus before coming to a decision, however.  t 

Honestly I don't there is any need to """"satisfy"""" anyone who is not content with it.  The cruft is barely (if at all) notable enough to be in this article.  Never mind its own.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  

I don't think obvious personal bias against this (or any game for that matter) should be a motivator for any article changes.    —Preceding comment was added at  

The obvious personal bias of a few overzealous gamers is the reason the article's so bloated with trivial data to begin with.  I'm with Ookami, this game just plain isn't notable enough to warrant a chapter by chapter breakdown of its storyline.  That's what fan sites are for.   

Just checked the World of Warcraft page out of curiosity, and even it doesn't have this much detailed story description.  In fact it barely has any, and I don't think anyone can argue which of the two games is more notable.  Also someone further up the page here brought this issue up already under 'generic story', why is this still being allowed?  

I play this game, I could care less that the huge exposition was taken out. That was an absolutely ridiculous story summary; most of the people that play the game couldn't tell you half of it. However, to kill the previous, argument, WoW barely has a story, while the Matrix Online's main content and selling point is the story. We don't need a 20 paragraph summary like before. A mention that there have been past live events, as well as a 4 sentence or so story summary, should suffice. I'd challenge one of you to do it, as I don't think any of you know anything about the game in the current state, besides that it is much weaker than World of Warcraft.   
To clarify my point above, I think the storyline section is very good now, it does, however, need the slightest mention of what has happened.   

Just for clarification, the game's main selling point was not the story itself, but that the players would be shaping the story, which never happened.  And WoW has plenty of story, enough to fill reams of Wikipages, it's just that it doesn't belong here in that great of detail.  This is supposed to be an encyclopedia, not a novel.  

Well, since there seems to be some rough consensus that this is well overdone, and that there has been no real objection to it, and pending the fact that no one with the adequate experience within the game has stepped forward to trim it down and keep whatever are the key points, I'm going to purge it.Talk|@ 
Per the anon-IP user's objection in the page history of the main article...  It doesn't matter.  Its that simple.

 Klein, Max, and Piotr Konieczn. """"Wikipedia in the World of Global Gender Inequality Indices."""" Proceedings of the 11th International Symposium on Open Collaboration - OpenSym '15 (2015): n. pag. Web. . While Wikipedia's editor gender gap is important but difficult to measure, its biographical gender gap can more readily be measured. We correlate a Wikipedia-derived gender inequality indicator (WIGI), with four widespread gender inequality indices in use today (GDI, GEI, GGGI, and SIGI). Analysing their methodologies and correlations to Wikipedia, we find evidence that Wikipedia's bias in biographical coverage is related to the gender bias in positions of social power.

Kalla, Joshua L., and Peter M. Aronow. """"Editorial Bias in Crowd-Sourced Political Information."""" PLOS ONE PLoS ONE 10.9 (2015): n. pag. Web. . In this paper, we examine what kinds of biases exist in crowd-sourced information on Wikipedia. Because any user can also be an editor, no one person with any particular ideological or partisan motivation should be able to control Wikipedia. Yet scholars have recognized the tension that comes from distributed, crowd-sourced platforms like Wikipedia. On the one hand, crowd-sourced information platforms create opportunities for citizens to challenge media-driven narratives. On the other, these platforms may be captured by the self-interested who have the greatest motivation to shape them for their own benefit.

I concur that this article should be unlocked, because, for example, see also my request for another year-old source to be updated, which is crucial as it is in the lede, and claiming that the RAO hypothesis is still the mainstream hypothesis in human evolution, when even those anthropologists who are cited as calling it the """"mainstream"""" hypothesis have retracted that claim and you are therefore basically misinforming a new generation of K-12 students, year-by-year, as you've kept this page outdated since 2010.

In another future-set episode, """"Future-Drama"""" Bart's girlfriend mentions she wants to make love to him on prom night, and becomes disappointed when he denies her. She says, """"I never had this problem with Todd Flanders!"""", implying a strong, though latent, sexuality in the boy. Also, in Home Away From Homer, Ned moves away and then moves back to Springfield. When announcing this to the boys, Rod says he has a girlfriend. Benjiboi """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Saul Friedlander states that """"a man above all: Hitler"""" started the process and that it was not """"generated in the machinery of Nazi and SS administration"""". That is quite normal he argues in that direction, given he is an """"intentionalist"""".

""""Martin Broszat and Hans Mommsen, however argued that [the mass murder] occured without any specific and comprehensive Hitler decision or order. The system's automatic mechanisms for 'cumulative radicalization' more than Hitler's ideology and leadership explained the origin of the Final Solution""""  
 Gerald Fleming, Hitler and the Final Solution, University of California Press, 1987, p.II writes 
""""It may be tempting to state that each approach has its merits and to seek an synthesis between the two positions. In fact, functionalism, which stresses the dynamics of a system instead of a central role of a leader, fits better in many ways within the mainstream of modern historiography. The image it offers of Nazism is more 'normal', easier to explain: any group can stumble hapharzadly, from step to step, into the most extreme criminal behavior. Responsibility remains obviously; but it is more deluted, more nebulous, because of the very automatism of the process, its outcome unforseeable, and because of the absence of real premeditation as well. Intentionalism at the other hand asserts that the course of action was in some way planned. This latter view gives Hitler a predominant role, but it also implies much greater awareness at various level; whereas functionalism pushed to its logical conclusion, gets very close to denying that Hitler had accurate knowledge of the Final Solution. It leaves most of the operation to subordinates agencies - in a nutshell, to police terror.""""

The same user who wrote the Sacred Order of Skull and Crescent Article, and created The Pugilist Club article you cited, is also meddling with the Barbaro Family page.  I found numerous inconsistencies with that SOSC (Sacred Order of Skull and Crescent) article which he attempted to explain away citing unnamed sources, or sources only he claims to have access to. He has edited my personal comments on the discussion page of that article in what appears to me to be an attempt to cover his mistakes.  In the discussion page of his SOSC article he has referenced pugilism, Amelia Earhart, the Wright Brothers, and a letter by Daniel Russell to a Bro. Chase, a letter which is also cited in his article on the alleged Skull and Crescent Order as being one of their prized artifacts.  The citing of this letter was the final straw for me.  I was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt, but when I found that letter quite amazingly and coincidentally while researching Theta Nu Epsilon on ebay of all places, it became clear that the article on the Sacred Order of the Skull and Crescent was founded mainly, if not wholly, on this individual's fantasies.  That letter can still be found on ebay by putting 200101453405, the item number into the ebay search. When I casually conronted the author of the Sacred Order of the Skull and Crescent wikipedia article with this, he initially presented a fantastic notion that perhaps the SOSC members were engaging in the ruse of selling their sacred artifacts to themselves in order to make them look worthless.  When I gave the ebay item number, then he quite suddenly and conveniently recalled that oh yes, he just remembered that in his unavailable source it says they reprinted copies of this letter for their members and that this must be one of those ultra rare reprints.  The buyer (obviously the author of the Skull and Crescent article, The Pugilist Club, and the bastardizer of the Barbaro Family page) left positive feedback for it.  Any dullard can tell an original hand written letter from a copy, if it were a copy negative feedback would have been left. Then upon looking into the publicly available links to items this same person purchased on the online auction site, I found many other fraternity related items as well as Amelia Earhart, Wright Brothers, and pugilism posters! Now I find the author's wikipedia alias is Tiki-Two.  Well, that name is almost exactly what the ebay user who purchased this masonic letter uses! 

I do not know what his motives are, but it seems he (perhaps in conjunction with associates) are building a hoax on wikipedia, possibly as members of a fraternity. It is possible that he is building a collection of items that he intends to present and cite in articles as important artifacts of secret societies.  As a relative outsider to wikipedia, I don't know what course to take, and really don't have the time to find out.  I mainly enjoy reading wikipedia articles, not engaging in what to me is vain online argumentation.  This individual may find and delete this post, but hopefully it will get through to someone at wikipedia who knows what to do.  Wikipedia should not be used to further some publicity stunt or fraternity hoax.  

There is no record anywhere else online of a Vitus Sebastian Barbaro that I can find.  There is no record anywhere else online of The Sacred Order of Skull and Crescent either.  There is no record of a """"Pugilist Club"""" aka """"Fight Club"""" at Purdue anywhere else online.

Action is clearly warranted. Archived or not, as I said, I am not going to let this lie, I will be informing Cailil when he returns. In addition to sanctioning Highking, I expect he will want to take issue with you disrespecting him by completely ignoring all the effort he went to in detailing exactly what is wrong with HighKing's behaviour, and what he should be avoiding. Who I am is completely and utterly irrelevant to whether or not HighKing is ignoring those warnings and engaging in the beahviour Cailil described as being not wanted here. He even made that exact point to HighKing - while Cailil has sympathy with the so called harassment he often claims to be suffering as a way of avoiding sanctions for making these edits, Cailil was crystal clear on the point that who reports him, or even just the mere presence of suspect accounts in any of these reports/disputes, has absolutely no bearing on whether or not he will act on any poor behaviour he observes from HighKing. I know he has previously expressed frustration at seemingly being the only admin here who is prepared to deal with HighKing, and I can see why with actions like this. Your closure of the section simply because of who the complainents are has only one effect - rewarding HighKing for bad edits. It's really no skin off my nose, is it?

Of course not. The only thing it achieves is to remove from sight as an immediate issue. Which, given the fact Cailil was at pains to point out that HighKing's poor behaviour stretches back to 2008, is not a good thing for Wikipedia. You're an admin. You're expected to deal with long term problems, not sweep them under the carpet for wholly irrelevant reasons. If HighKing were ever to end up at arbitration for example, do you think he would escape sanction for persistent WP:TE behaviour, simply because other people involved were not following some completely unrelated rule like WP:SOCK? Of course not. Hopefully you can at least appreciate that as an admin, you being the person who maintains that cycle of WP:TE, is not only bad for Wikipedia, it's a form of laxity that really isn't excused by who I may or may not be. It also had the material effect of me not being able to correct Murray on a basic point of fact, meaning the archive now has errors in it, which I am sure is not the intent of that facility. Archive or no archive, at the very least, if, or more likely when, Cailil sanctions HighKing for those edits, I expect you to hold your hands up and admit your failure to do your duty as an admin in this case. Anything less will simply fall well below the expected standards of admins on Wikipedia. Anyway, I've probably spent far too long typing a post that you will most likely just ignore and delete, so goodbye for now.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Apparently, the dispute is over whether the term """"Greek Macedonians"""" should be used to refer to the Greek Macedonians. While it is a sourced term and is in use by academics as has been demonstrated above, there is a strong refusal to including it. The Greek insistence to including this term is primarily to prevent the much feared monopolisation of the name """"Macedonia"""" by Fyrom, whose editors oppose using the term for reasons I have difficulty understanding.

Proposal

Look all I am saying is that the term """"Iranian"""" is a very loose term and people can get easily confused when they see this. Iranic would be a better term to use. Nontheless, there is no doubt that the Kurdish language is a bit similar to other languages such as Persian but there is also a difference as well. I am speaking as a Kurd myself. There is evidence that the Kurds have the highest chance out of all the other ethnic groups of being descendants of the Medes, all one has to do is look at lingustics. Although, it is also important to know that the Kurds have been in the middle east for a very very long time, and there have been many other empires/people as well. There have also been, for example, claims that Kurds are also descendants of the Gutians. It all boils down to what you believe, but to say that the Kurds are an Iranian people, is sort of going overboard. 

Kurds have been mentioned for a very longtime by many different people, including the Sumerians!

Nonetheless, I think there should be a change. I sort of agree with the Proposal above but I believe it can be better. Heres what I think should be written

Kurds are an ethnic group in the Middle East that inhabit adjacent parts of Turkey, Iran, Iraq, and Syira known as Kurdistan. The Kurds speak a language known as Kurdish, which form a subgroup of the NorthWestern Iranian languages. The Kurds are known to be an Iranic people because of close linguistic and cultural ties with other Iranians. The Kurds are also known to be descendants of the Medes, according to many scholars.

Somewhere along those lines. Saying that Kurds are an """"Iranian ethnic group"""" is is vague, confusing, and somewhat mis-leading. What I wrote is a bit more clear and I wrote why they are considered an Iranic people with the sentences supporting it. Notice how I also said a language known as Kurdish. I do not know on what insane consensus that people decided it should be """"Kurdish language(s)."""" Kurdish is one language which is mainly based of two dialects, that are spoken by almost all Kurds. Those two dialects are Kurmanji and Sorani, both of which are highly similar. All Kurds regard their language as one. I am a Kurdish Sorani speaker and I can understand a Kurmanji speaker perfectly. Kurds in Turkey, Syria, and Half of Iraq speak Kurmanji. Then the other Half of Iraqi Kurdistan speak Sorani, with Kurds in Iran speaking Kurdish Sorani as well. There are also a few other dialects such as Hawrami which is spoken by about 10% of Kurds. Nonetheless, the Kurdish language is one language with 2 main dialects, both of which are highly similar to each other.

You're obviously confused between phonetics as found in the study of, say, modern languages and the proper representation of sounds in protolanguages.

6dc8ef52010d5c3a,""":Hi there. Thanks for your concern on the matter. I can assure you this has little to nothing to do with """"mathematician vs physicist"""" as you have proposed; it, instead, has everything to do with Linas incompetence. It is univerally acknowledged that a complex function SQUARED can be negative. This is nothing new or exciting: consider f(x) = i if you don't believe me. The square modulus of a wavefunction is what the probability defined in the context of wavefunctions. 

Remarkably, someone who pretends he is so knowledgeable in mathematics and physics - indeed, even stating to me that I do not know Quantum Mechanics and hence should not edit articles - could make such a terrible fumble. Without saying it for effect, his lack of understanding between the square modulus and the square of a complex number if a lack of understanding of day one material: literally, my Complex Analysis book (by Conway, Graduate Texts in Mathematics series) covers it in the first section, and again literally, my mathematical physics course as an undergraduate covered this on the first day of class.

Linas, you are incompetent. People tend to make errors at the periphery of their knowledge. As it turns out, the edge of your knowledge is day one in complex variables. Please refrain from editing articles on quantum mechanics and mathematics. You clearly do not know what you are talking about.

6e019e391650cfcc,"Honestly the way wiki is treating this is a JOKE

a. I could have cited NEWS SITES but since when is a news site worthy of an academic cite?

b. if the person that wanted PEER REVIEW felt like it, he would have sought it 20 years ago, HE CHOSE NOT TO DO IT, but none the less his work is known and was mentioned in many math related 'forums' and most ignored it. 

c. Only the recent 2012 open source test of the work PROVED the 30Mod algorithm is a major thing in math, again, GITHUB is a programmers resource and it was not until a computer used the actual 30Mod algorithm that it was shown to be a 'big thing' and since then some news sites have covered it, but I chose not to cite them due to IMO they are not NPOV. But none the less they covered the story.

d. The FACT is a major computer site where programmers have free reign to challenge any claims exists and for over two years not one programmer challenged the findings.

e. so what if the person that discovered it works outside of academia and has no regard for normal 'peer review' the fact is he has no peers if you ask some in academia that know of his work, and I am one of those people that know of the work and how brilliant the work is.

Now to summarize, we have a bunch of pags about primes on wiki, and even pages created after his discovery that USE his discovery (ie. the sieve of Atkin 60Mod work is his work discussed in the public forum and usenet math and physics forums is where he chose to discuss his amazing work.

So now you have 2004 sieve of Atkin using a 60Mod algorithm, guess what that was in his 1995 paper. So does wiki acknowledge that? No. And i didn't even bother to waste my time of the 60 mod algorithm since the big deal as you are saying is the PyPrimes test and I cited that very well, it's a program created in Python, I cited the wiki python page, then I cited Github for both PyPrimes and the PyPrimes testing.

Now while MATH is m forte, I am sufficient enough in computer skills to understand what Github is and to understand how to read the speed tests and the prime spirals smoked every algorithm there is. Now anyone can download python (which I have done) and download pyprimes (which I have done) and run the tests. Guess what just like a math experiment, it is duplicated.

So GITHUB and the tests which are not 'new' should be enough to begin a wiki page on this truly amazing discovery in math.

I myself became aware of the first paper in 1995, as did others in aademia. Recently I became aware of 'news sites' running stories citing what I copied, the links to the Github tests.

While some here can say well it's not AMA, so what, in the world of primality testing primes spirals as per the PyPrimes results shows PRIME SPIRALS are a big deal.

Now I tried to be NPOV in giving all sides of the story, Adoni has a valid 1995 claim I can verify it and I chose not to. But I cited a Drexel Math forum and I could have cited many other math sites discussing his 30mod, 60mod and 90mod prime work in the 1990's. Is this signficant? You bet it is since 60Mod prime sieve aka Atkin sieve is 20004 so his 60mod prime work is well before it.

Now the Github tests mentions 'croft spirals', that's due to in 2010 a person named croft registering a web site and ripping off the 1995 work. MY OPINION.

Now Croft can say all he wants that he found it playng his guitar or whatever he is claiming.

The fact is anyone can document Adoni with Prime theory from the 1990's saying 30mod, 60mod and 90mod is the key.

9 Years later sieve of atkin appears, well that's only a rehash of the adoni 60mod work from the 1990's. Yet no one is giving him credit.

2010 croft puts out his 30Mod work and its inserted into PyPrimes on Github and it smokes every major prime algorithm there is and all of them have pages on wiki as I cited.

So 2012 a work on Github verifies how important to primality the 30mod spirals are, but he says croft spirals, well guess what HelixQ is now out there and taking 100% credit for the 1995 work of Dr. Adoni.

My site to a Drexel math site from the 1990's mentioning 30Mod prime work (prime spirals) is a major cite, since Adoni could care less about the AMA or whatever, in all probability he will soon be nominated for a Nobel on his work, that is how important it is. 

Think about it, not one prime algorithm could beat the ancient sieve of Eratosthenes, none of them. On a computer creating primes all other algorithms are terribly slow. The only two fast generators from scratch are the ancient sieve of Eratosthenes and the PRIME SPIRALS, and the winner was Prime Spirals. Now I can cite recent news articles about it, laughing at academics it links to that said it was no big deal in the 1990's who now all look foolish due",1,0,0,0,0,0

- As somebody else said, the """"nation of Transylvania"""" DOES NOT EXIST, it is pure ROMANIA and Romanians! Therefore, we will tell some real history here. Within the chronicles of Herodotus , one may find that he described the Dacians(Getae) as the nation living within the present Romanian and Moldavian territory, including the part that is called Transylvania today, which means “beyond the forests”, after the Latin definition given by Romans and which consisted of the Carpathian Mountains and the Pannonian Plains. A more accountable map can be found here: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Dacia_82_BC.png .. Therefore, the nation living there consisted of dacians, which were known as Geton (plural Getae) in Greek writings, and as Dacus (plural Daci) and Getae in Roman documents. The dacians were conquered, after great efforts, by the Romans and Dacia was transformed into a Roman Province. Following, it was  a period of Romanization, period when the main Romanian people rose. As an answer to the Magyar origin, the history says that their starting point within the actual Hungary is related to the invasion of the Mongols ruled by Genghis Han and the Huns ruled by Attila within the European territory. After their settlement within the Pannonian Plains, the Hungarian people emerged, by mixing with the local populations. As a clear conclusion, one may say that nobody can contradict the written past or the great historians in terms of the origin of Dacians and the territory within they lived, called today Transilvania/Transylvania. The truth that has to be admitted is that Dacians/Getae were here as a nation BEFORE the Hungarian people came over and rose as a nationality. Moreover, NEITHER the Mongols and Huns NOR the actual Hungarians WERE here BEFORE the Romanization of Dacians, therefore they were not present before the emerging stage of the Romanian people. International history admits that the Hungarians appeared within today’s Hungary territory around the 9th century A.C. (according to Britannica) as an immigrating people coming from the actual Tibet region/Mongolia. After settlement they conquered Transilvania and nowadays they fabricate they were first to live on this land. Bear in mind that Romanians will never stop claiming their internationally admitted origin, dating from Daco-Romans times and they will never stop viewing Trasilvania as their own home! If the Hungarians want to live without conflicts, they should stop claiming what does not belong to them, the Transylvania land. PEACE!

Spamming: Posting an excessive number of messages to individual users, or to users with no significant connection to the topic at hand.
Campaigning: Posting a notification of discussion that presents the topic in a non-neutral manner.
Vote-stacking: Posting messages to users selected based on their known opinions (which may be made known by a userbox, user category, or prior statement). Vote-banking involves recruiting editors perceived as having a common viewpoint for a group, similar to a political party, in the expectation that notifying the group of any discussion related to that viewpoint will result in a numerical advantage, much as a form of prearranged vote stacking.
Stealth canvassing: Contacting users off-wiki (by e-mail, for example) to persuade them to join in discussions (unless there is a specific reason not to use talk pages)
Soliciting support other than by posting direct messages, such as using a custom signature with a message promoting a specific position on any issue being discussed.

I cant help it if you are blind & have ZERO attention to details. the image you replaced at Surat Railway Station is wrong for 4 very simple reason's which are somehow beyond your ability to understand simple things. So once again, i have to explain it to you like a kid with limited understanding.
1. The same image is on the Mumbai Rajdhani Page as being at Mumbai Central station. So unless you have come up with a miracle that converts Mumbai into Surat,you are wrong.
2. The image has been taken in bright sun light. 12951 Rajdhani Express arrives at Surat between 1937-1942 hrs so unless you have come up with another miracle & ensured bright sunlight at that time. Daylight may exist but not of such intensity.
3.If you would have ever visited Surat railway station, you would know that the layout of the station is very different from what the image claims.
4.The building in the background is far taller than what buildings in Surat are. Take a ride in the local trains of Mumbai & you may be able to see the same building there but in your case i have my doubts.

So take your hollow & empty threats elsewhere, EXCEPT for you rarely has anyone removed the images. As for contributions, your main history is largely made up of undoing others work.

Hi Howard and all the rest of you guys Americans or d'ailleurs,

I favor Howard's proposal of having an article to list all of the third-party participants in the Iran-Iraq War, not just a separate article for U.S.

I was kidding when I said that adding U.S. to both sides would fix the infobox, but not kidding in the sense that if someone sticks U.S. in one side, the history shows U.S. should be in both sides.

I am inclusionist with respect to the infobox and think that anybody who moved arms to either side should be included.  

All of this is hashed out ad naseum above but the new Iranian guy has kicked it all off again by throwing U.S. into the info box once again bringing us back into the grand and glorious infobox debate territory.

Also there are two other guys (C-Suit and B-Louie) going into endless debates about a single Iranian war slogan (something like """"Onward, beans and bagels, fight fight fight for Palestine"""" or something like that) that one insists is real and the other insists is invented but I can't for the life of me figure out why either of them considers it worthy of so much debate.  Oh yes, the slogan is """"We will keep fighting until we win"""".  You'd hope so, don't you think?  What else would they say, """"We will keep fighting until we stop fighting or whatever""""?  That would not be a very effective slogan!

Is there some way we can combine the slogan debate and the infobox debate into one huge bonfire of nitpicking?

I'd like that!

Hi

Sorry for my absence over the last few months but as winter is approaching I (as usual) have been sticken by arthritis, flu and travelling. From the end of August my time is usually limited as I have a lot of family events and the bad weather takes its toll on my health.

http://fornvannen.se/pdf/1980talet/1983_021.pdf
This article was edited and approved by the previous editor of Fornvännen Fil Dr Jan-Peder Lamm 
Fornvännen is a highly reputable magazine
Göran H. wrote the article in 1982.  Jan-Peder Lamm edited the article but  suggested that Göran H. should include a comparison with Stonehenge. Therefore did J-P L supply Göran H. with archaeological history about Stonehenge. Göran H. re-wrote the article with comparison with Stonhenge and the article was published in 1983.

Jan-Peder Lamm, born 27 October 1935, is a Swedish archaeologist. He received his PhD in 1973 from the University of Stockholm for a dissertation about a Migration Period elite cemetery near Drottningholm.
Lamm taught archaeology at the University of Stockholm in the 1970s and then worked until retirement as Head Curator for the Swedish Iron Age at the Museum of National Antiquities in Stockholm. He is a member of the editorial board behind the journal Fornvännen and has taken active part in the Helgö project since the 1960s.
Fornvännen (print: ISSN 0015-7813, online: ISSN 1404-9430) is a Swedish academic journal in the fields of archaeology and Medieval art. It is published quarterly by the Royal Swedish Academy of Letters in Stockholm, Sweden. The journal's contributions are written in the Scandinavian languages, English, or German with summaries in English. Fornvännen has the alternate title Journal of Swedish Antiquarian Research. The editor in chief is Lars Larsson.
Fornvännen began publication in 1906 when it replaced two earlier journals, Svenska Fornminnesföreningens Tidskrift and Vitterhetsakademiens Månadsblad. Early contributors included noted archaeologists Oscar Montelius and Hans Hildebrand.[1] Since 2000 it has an online version, since 2007 its first 100 annual volumes have been available on-line, and since 2009 Fornvännen is published as a delayed open-access journal with the online version of each issue appearing six months after the paper version.
Fornvännen is an ERIH category B journal. According to Ulrich's, it is indexed in Anthropological Index Online, Anthropological Literature, British & Irish Archaeological Bibliography (Online Edition), Nordic Archaeological Abstracts, and FRANCIS. It was previously also indexed in Internationale Bibliographie der Rezensionen Geistes- und Sozialwissenschaftlicher Literatur and Linguistic Bibliography.[2]

It's unfortunate that the history of Sicily here at Wiki is the sole province of this one individual, """"Racial Reality,"""" who is well-known amongst forum posters as being very biased against any research that shows admixture.  He feels he has the right to discredit all studies he disagrees with, and that everyone should accept his theories as absolute fact.  I could just as easily creat a website presenting an opposite view and discrediting studies that Racial Reality likes.  But I am not that dishonest.  My point was to present the other side of the story, while leaving Racial Reality's also valid side there as well; in this way, the reader can draw his or her own conclusions. But the way the article is now is extremely one-sided.

Blood group studies from the 1970's are not incorrect. This method has fallen out of fashion merely because it is less sensitive than the newer DNA method we have access to.  This fact doesn't discredit older studies that use blood groups, since the blood groups and blood proteins used are specific to certain populations.  Since the decoding of the human genome, we have access to more sensitive methods of determing admixture.  

An example of how blood groups studies are valid is the Duffy null marker. The Duffy blood-group types have been known for many decades, as has their usefulness in identifying continent of ancestry. But it has been only within the past decade that we have known that a person's Duffy blood-group type is encoded on the long arm of his/her chromosome #1, about 23.2 centimorgans out from the chromosome's centromere. 

In general, you can measure the end-result of a person's genetic makeup by serological analysis (blood group tests), or you can measure the actual genetic makeup itself in the DNA. The latter is more precise since some proteins are produced (or not) only in homozygotes and so are invisible to serological analysis but visible in the DNA. If anything, serological analysis will understimate true admixture. 

The Ghiani study specifically states that it shows significant admixture.  Anyone can see this when reading the abstract. However, what they mean by """"significant"""" is """"statistically significant"""", not that a large portion of Sicilians' DNA is African. Five percent or more is usually considered statistically significant.

The Calo study presents support for the east-west division in Sicily, and shows relatedness between Sicilians and Egyptians.  Egyptians were imported to Sicily during the Saracen period as farmers, so the connection between Sicilians and Egyptians is not spurious. The study's use of perfectly valid blood group and mtDNA studies which show sub-Saharan admixture in Sicily were merely to show that other studies found """"African"""" admixture there, regardless of whether it was sub-Saharan or North African.  There are other studies which lump the two together. The whole point was to show a relationship with the (diverse) peoples of the continent of Africa.

The Semino study from 1989 which found 4 sub-Saharan haplotypes out of a population of 91 diverse Sicilians is not """"problematic,"""" as Racial Reality would have us believe, but is a perfectly valid mtDNA study using restriction enzymes, a method still widely used today, since it is cost-effective and accurate.  RFLP's cut the DNA at specified locations, and """"indels"""" (insertion and deletions polymorphisms) are very easy to spot in this way. There are other studies that have found less (or in one case, no) sub-Saharan material in the Sicilian gene pool.  This is normal, since all samples are different, and because of this, all tests will yield different results.  One certainly can't """"refute"""" or """"overrule"""" the other.  The 2001 Vona study (finding no sub-Saharan genes in Sicilians) that referenced the 1989 Semino study did so for comparison purposes only.  Furthermore, it tested only 49 Siclians from the single villige of Alia.  No reliable conclusions can be reached for the Sicilian population as a whole from such a narrow sample.  Dr. Ornella Semino, a former colleage of mine, found it both amusing and a bit disturbing when I mentioned to here that certain non-professional forum posters considered her study """"outdated"""" or """"overruled"""" or """"refuted""""  all absolute drivel!

Lastly, the person who wrote this...

""""Lastly, talk of races is all hogwash in any event...""""

...should be aware that the person made the steward of all things Sicilian, the above-mentioned Racial Reality, is a proponent of the existence of races...just look at his handle.

I am a retired geneticist, and I do believe I have something valuable to contribute.  Incidentally, I am of partial Sicilian ancestry, and am proud of all who contributed to that great island's melting-pot population.  I hope at least some of what I've said will be taken to he",0,0,0,0,0,0

I only came across the dispute quite recently, although the article was on my watchlist as a vandalism target. This editor insists on writing """"jesus"""" (quotation marks, and lower case) all over the talk page, to make the point that Jesus wasn't a real person, and for a while he was adding a paragraph saying that there was no evidence that he had ever existed. I do recall reading that the agreement was that if articles already had CE, they shouldn't be changed to AD, and if they had AD, they shouldn't be changed to CE. I haven't found the relevant page.

 The VERY Naive Perspective 

This was stated:

'There was no implication that ALL VNR's are propaganda.  If  SOME VNRs are demonstrably propaganda, which I infer is undisputed, then the statement is factually correct and ideologically neutral.'

Separated into two concepts: 
a) that """"There was no implication that ALL VNRs are propaganda."""" 
-and-
b) """"If  SOME VNRs are demonstrably propaganda ... then the statement is factually correct and ideologically neutral."""" 

In regards to the first:-
A Video """"News"""" Release by the government, which is ( as they, a priori, are ) intended to create the appearance of congruity for an idea which aids the government through causing an apparent or actual concordance between the beliefs of those in control and those being controlled is, by definition, propaganda.
In regards to the second:-
Is the statement that the labeling of VNR's is an ideologically neutral act?  It would not be, as, through labeling it, one is categorizing it ideologically. 

Please do not misunderstand, IMHO VNR's are an advanced form of embedded propaganda which elegantly use the psycholinguistic concept contained in the idea """"The Fish do not see the Water"""". In Communication Studies, Propaganda Studies, even Neuro-Linguistic Programming NLP( which, while it is a controversial system, is based on common-sense """"slight of mind"""" techniques.) the Sandwich Formula of:
/true statement -> statement intended to be perceived as true -> true statement/
is being used here. Example: 6 o'clock news, tired Americans sit down to eat and watch the news. In the middle of verifiable and true information segments a VNR is placed, so the end effect of 'Rain tomorrow //-> VNR Information //-> Gas is up by 1 cent' is to believe 3 new facts, not 2 and one to question.

Bad LOGIC

=Progressivism
On the progressivism and economic progressivism pages  some editors have deleted criticism on the following grounds.

1.  The article needs to be expanded first.
2.  The article needs to be improved first.
3.  Criticsm section puts undo weight on negatives.

Well I say this logic leads to only one outcome, the articles purpose is to argue the point which is a violation of NPOV.

1.  If the article needs expanding, expand it...criticism also helps expand.  THe purpose of the article is to report all the facts not just the facts in favor of the article title.
2.  The article is improved just by including a criticism section.  Again, THe purpose of the article is to report all the facts not just the facts in favor of the article title. Deleting the criticism on the grounds that the article needs to be improved suggests the only way to improve the article is by aruging the point. Again, violation of NPOV.
3.  Criticism does not put undo weight on negatives. Again the purpose of the article is not to argue the point of progressivism but to report the facts.
4.  The fact is criticism exists and it should be reported.  The criticism section included an AUthor and his book.
5.  The addition of a pov original research counter arguement to the criticism further proves my point (And you can look on the history page) that they believe the purpose of the article is to argue the point rather than report the facts.

All were poorly reasoned excuses to delete material they objected to.  These editors are not trying to preserve the integrity of wikipedia or be """"Fair and balanced"""" they are simply trying to push a leftist political objective by censoring any alternative regardless of the source.

Classical Liberalism

Editor Slizor has deleted several sections and paragraphs which were cited and refrenced, including quotes from economists and think tanks on various things which Slizor has expressed disagreement with.  Dispite these citations, he deleted the material on the grounds that what he believes is the truth does not fit the facts provided.  He claims, dispite contradictory evidence and no evidence of his own that classical liberals have nothing in common with libertarians.  That classical liberals are not inheritors of liberalism.  and that modern liberals do not have a different understanding of liberalism than 200 years ago.  Furthermore, he makes the original research pov claim that classical liberals are more like elitist Republicans than libertarians (for which he has NO CITATION, and this is one of the grounds for the deletions).

This is just another example of the abuse some wiki editors will make up in order to push their own agenda.

The logic is poor.  The citation is non existant.  The pov is massive.  Slizor's edit needs a massive revert...and he needs to be drawn away from his computer and beaten with Milton Friedman and FA Hayek books until he understands the quotes from their books that he deleted.  ( )""",0,0,0,0,0,0

If you're going to toss around numbers of """"real"""" scientists, I will point out that there has been some question as to how many of the """"thousands of scientists"""" involved in the IPCC consensus process are actually scientists working in the area of climate change.  If you're going to make ad hominem attacks on the opponents of global warming, it might be interesting to analyze the credentials of the scientists on both sides of the issue.  I wonder if anyone has actually done this analysis for both sides of the debate.  I think it's unlikely, given the partisan nature of the debate.  It's far more likely that each side of the debate assumes their """"experts"""" are all wonderful and importantant scientists, while the other side's experts are obviously incompetent and bought off.  

 Global Warming Non-Believers

They published an open letter to Ban Ki-Moon, available at http://www.nationalpost.com/news/story.html?id=164002.  Interestingly, there are also scientific claims made within this letter (such as the claim that there has been no global warming since 1998) that probably also need to be addressed in the article.

(r to my favorite editor, started before Spotfixer commented:)
Not months, years. He'd been shoveling that shit on Shapiro since 2006. Anyway, thanks for the kind words - coming from one in your time and place it's especially touching that you'd be aggrieved over my two week time out from a website.
I often despair of ever getting anything done here. The most basic, obvious, and straightforward applications of policy often take many man-hours, and even a victory never establishes any kind of precedent - the same discredited arguments are just brought to a new forum. Outright deceit goes unpunished; editors say X=100, citing a source that says X=-5, and get away with it. I mean, look at my own block log, for example.
The first time I was blocked, it was because a devotedly Jewish and obsessively Zionist admin baited me until he ran out of his 3 reverts - he actually put """"rv#1, rv#2, rv#3..."""" in his edit summaries - then, literally five minutes later, a notorious """"kamikaze edit warrior"""" with a laser-like focus on Israeli-Palestinian articles shows up to make his first ever edit to the article, I revert him, and then I've crossed the magic 3RR trip wire and I'm blocked. Ffs, even the guy that blocked me - who incidentally was a United States Air Force reservist with a combat record over Afghanistan - ended up scolding Humus Sapiens for his actions. But no sanctions, of course - that's reserved for people who say """"fuck"""" or click """"undo"""" four times instead of three, not for deranged ethno-nationalists who conspire in secret. Those types get admin bits instead, in honour of all the vandalism they've cleansed from articles about Pokemon.
The second time I was blocked, it was because I lost my temper with a semi-literate buffoon, who quoted in boldface """"huge numbers of Palestinians were also driven out of their homes by their own leaders and/or by Arab military forces"""" claiming it supported his text, """"the vast majority of Palestinians fled of their own accord."""" He quoted this triumphantly, as if he had convincingly refuted my argument and exposed me as a liar. The microcephale in question now appears to be on track to becoming an admin. He'll be in good company.
This is not an anomaly. Just prior to my block, I was working on the lede of our article on the 2008 Gaza war, which for some reason still bears a euphemistic title """"Israeli-Gazan conflict"""" or some such nonsense. The lede claimed that """"other Palestinian estimates differ"""" from the """"Hamas-run"""" Gazan hospital system; the only relevant article cited, a piece in the conservative """"home team"""" Israeli newspaper Jerusalem Post, actually noted a very close correlation between Ministry of Health estimates, endorsed by the World Health Organization, independent estimates, and even the Israeli estimate of overall fatalities (although IDF insists that the number of combatants was far greater, but only off the record and without specifics.) Two separate editors reverted my correction. I mean, how can we stand for this? Who the fuck cares about """"incivility"""" and """"personal attacks"""" when editors are lying about the content of sources and getting away with it? These people didn't read the sources. They didn't care about the sources. They just knew, because they wanted it to be true, that Palestinian casualty counts were all lies, so they edited the article to say so. I am sick of dealing with this kind of bullshit. What can I say, my patience is not unlimited.
I don't mean to make this out as if every editor who has a pro-Israel point of view is some kind of Satanic monster. I respect Steve/sm8900. I respect Avraham. I respect Ceedjee (and I still don't know where he stands except that he's downright mean to anybody who doesn't stand with him!) Hell, I even respect JayJG in my own twisted way, at least he's entertaining, if only in the fashion of a heel. But this endless stream of nonsense wears one down. I genuinely enjoy reasoned debate on talk pages, ok? But when people lie, cheat, dissemble, and filibuster, I'm going eventually to blow up. Deal with it.

(I note with irony my own advice to a newbie: Try and keep your cool, because WP seems to take an extremely hard line against """"incivility"""" from editors perceived as pro-Palestinian. They will always portray you as a crazy extremist, so it is best to support your arguments with solid """"mainstream"""" sources. [...] You have to be kind of single-minded, I think. Don't allow any opportunity for them to turn the discussion away from the real issues. Word your comments carefully so they cannot be twisted into some alternate interpretation to be used against you.

""""unconditional"""" aspect of BI, doesn't mean there is no forms to fill out and no approval needed

""""government-insured guarantee"""" is pure GI, because the implementation is to subsidize people up to an income level.

Basic income of $10000 means that you receive $10000 no matter what your other income is.

Why are so many of you acting like 8 year olds and ruining what used to be a decent page on Steve Jobs?  

His father was Paul Jobs - what dumb idiot called Justin changed it to Justin Paul Jobs?

He was born in San Francisco - look up the 2006 archives.

The purchase of what was later named Pixar, from Lucas, is fully covered in the archives.  The price, the date etc. From the official sales records.  Are you so lazy that you prefer to make things up rather than do decent research?  You only have to click """"Archives"""" on the discussion page.  What is so taxing about that?

 Jobs does not have pancreatic cancer 

Steve Jobs has a neuroendocrine tumor """"NET"""" that is located on his pancreas.  As a Carcinoid Cancer/NET survivor and activist, this is a very important distinction.

````Please do not block me for trying to improve the integrity of the article.
Hello, My name is JohnHistory. I was recently blocked for my mentioning of major problems here because I did not assume """"Good Faith"""" when confronted with bad faith. I believe that the biggest problem with this article and thus the best way to improve it is to intensely follow the Jimbo guidelines to the T. I am going to post what I wrote on my talk page after being blocked during the controversy here. I could be more covert in my contempt for violations especially given my long but yet humble ranking amongst the Wiki Elite but abusing editors and monitors must be accountable or we will always suffer from their petty tyranny. This surely does not make me popular amongst them, yet I must assume """"good faith"""" in them so that they will not prejudice their views against me and comfort their own politics in the process.
I was accused of supporting things I never did. All I ask is that criticism be included on par with other presidents. That is all. I don't especially care about Rev Wright, etc but if it is historical record and part of historically long campaign then I will stick my neck out for it.
I have to say that the amount of bashing of media and talk that has nothing to do with improving the article is highly tolerated if it is left leaning but anything even center of that is treated with heavy hand and often banished and erased. that is what struck me about the discussion page - mind you I never made an edit on the actual article I was banned for merely talking on a talk page. it was the idea that these so called monitors are in fact just random non scholars at home abusing the tools of wikipedia to further their almost personal agenda in a group- think environment.
Thin skin is no excuse for being literally fascistic in your approach to the open to the public - controlled by a small group of ideologues - Wikipedia. These political minding ideologues are 80-100% dominated by left wing or leaning people and controlled through even the excessive use of blocking for discussion posts and factual additions. These (not just mine) are non threatening non- offensive language - just the idea of one stating that their is a problem with the editors and monitors is cause to be blocked and potentially banned for not """"assuming good faith"""" or """"positively contributing to the consensus"""". what if the consensus is wrong then? What if about if you have already assumed Good Faith long ago and are simply diagnosing the major illness of the article as you see it? The evidence is more then abundant that these monitors are violating their tools and are involved in subterfuge or at least strong bias as evidenced between comparing Obama with W Bush. Additionally, the Obama Administration through proxies, in my strong opinion, is at work in the Obama article. I say this mainly because it is inconceivable to me that given the current administrations use and celebration of all things internet and aggressive pursuit of media outlets and shaping the publics opinion (as is understandable) that someone out of the thousands of Obama connected likely people is not involved on the Barack Obama page. It is the most visited page on Wikipedia and is one of the top hits for people searching the internet for the name Barack Obama. However, that is secondary to the already abundant supply of ideologue editors and monitors who seem to fill the demographic of the wikipedia junior officer ranks who enough of is all that it really takes. The number of those is in the millions. That is Why Jimbo guidelines must be followed as an example of the integrity of wikipedia as a REAL encyclopedia that could stand out in a scholarly work. The language given the Rulers of Wikipedia gives them broad ability to block and ban anyone they disagree with. OFten the language is contradictory. For instance I was blocked for my comments on the TALK page and cited for """"Making a point instead of wanting to edit"""". How, exactly, do you make a TALK page based discussion about edits without making a point? Another monitor told me I had to assume good faith, yet no good faith was given to me in my quest to improve article. In addition, the """"TALK"""" page says no writing will be allowed that involves """"general discussion"""" however that can be loosely interpreted and it could for instance only be 5% of what you wrote and then be grounds by a prejudiced monitor to remove your entire sections containing many posts. Additionally, the last guideline about general talk is only applied to people making comments critical or potentially scandalous to the President of the United stat",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Which picture?   Incidentally I'm writing about UK law. American law used to be marginally different. For instance to have copyright in the UK you only have show your work to someone, whereas in America I think you have to send it to the Library of Congress - books anyway. Also you used to have claim copyright separately in different countries. Then there's publishing rights, a whole different can of worms.

 I think that a picture such as Image:Pottsville court house.gif is liable to be a double copyvio - of the original postcard (if still in copyright) and of the gif image.

""""The footpath sign was a result of an abortive attempt to photograph the south portal of the Milford Tunnel - I did not think the golfers would take kindly to my walking across their fairways and I am not sure how else to get to it."""" When I went train spotting, I used to walk along the edge of the field at the opposite side off the Milford Road, opposite the signal box. The North Portal is said to be prettier and you seem to have caught it in a rare moment when it wasn't deep in shade. I like 058133 - the train gives it a bit of movement.

There are loads of photos around but they are all copyright. My solution is to link to  websites that are lkely to be permanent. """"Picture the Past"""" has a photo of Toadmoor Tunnel which really shows the elliptical shape.

058162 would show Ambergate station as it is now. Belper and Duffield have been similarly erased.

Appealing is without purpose. It is my observation that you do not follow the rules of Wikipedia, so pointing out to you anything wrong in your action, wrongful by Wikipedia rules, is meaningless. 

When the majority do not see any problem with requiring some people to sit in the back of the bus, it ain't going to change by pointing out their actions to them. I live with racism every day; but pointing out to someone on Wikipedia how their actions are akin to the majority imposing its will upon the minority, and refusing to explain their actions, that is, to give some facts behind the conclusory rhetoric of those refusing to allow any edit on the topic at hand, or even answer the question with some mention of what part of a long rule they are talking about (as Chowbok asked), then I've been uncivil and the metaphor is offensive.

The rules, in application, are: Your friends can make personal attacks on those you do not know, your friends can be insulting to those you do not know. Those you do not know-and-like are in the wrong. How dare those you do not know raise a question, or worse yet, ask that another's question, long asked but never answered, be answered?

I am putting it here, kindly read the whole story alongwith the proofs.

It appears that Admin User:Abecedare has ended up doing some big injustice without checking the facts. Per he has blocked anon User: 32.177.111.155 simply because he was trying to protect Wikipedia. Please correct this error otherwise this injustice and blocking comments are going to harm both innocent editors ( User: 32.177.111.155 and User: 209.183.55.115  ) and their zeal to work on wikipedia and their future contributions/history as well.

Why User Talk: 32.177.111.155's Block was unjustified

User Talk: 32.177.111.155’s edits do not constitute vandalism

He simply restored duly referenced text. 
 Proof 1
 Proof 2
 Proof 3

 User Talk: 32.177.111.155 did not violate WP:3rr 

He did not violate WP:3RR and he simply quit editing.

 User Talk: 32.177.111.155 can not be a called a sockpuppet

 It was mentioned that User: 209.183.55.115 is licensed to Concord, CA and User: 32.177.111.155 is licensed to Los Angeles. Both of these cities are 6-7 hours of drive from each other? And it usually takes 1.5 hours of flight time if you want to fly from one city to another. 
  against violation of Wikipedia policies. Is simple warning constitute sockpuppetry?
If  had owned 2nd IP 209.183.55.115 as well, then he could have participated in the edit war through 2nd IP while staying within WP:3RR. It means he was not related to the 2nd IP at all.

Why ’s edits constitute violation of Wikipedia policies

Editor  repeatedly deleted duly referenced tex

Edit 1 
edit 2 
Edit 3 

Editor  repeatedly lied

 lied/mislead Wikipedia community through his edit summaries and statements.
Edit 1 – edit summary “Google Books isn't a very reliable source. Find a better source than that..”
edit 2 – edit summary “Reverted 1 edit by 32.177.111.155 identified as vandalism to last revision by Neutralhomer”
Edit 3 – edit summary “Reverted 1 edit by 32.177.111.155 identified as vandalism to last revision by Neutralhomer”
again lied that city of Concord and city of Los Angeles are next to each other to get the opposing editors blocked under sock category.

Editor  repeatedly violated WP:POV 

User:Neutralhomer ruthlessly suppressed others voice and kept on removing the referenced text by blatantly refusing to accept the wp:rs reliability of various internationally known newspapers and a very notable google book which is already part of wikipedia, i.e. Reduced to Ashes (book). User:Neutralhomer refused to accept following references only because he could not like them:

This article is primarily about the World Cricket League and, although the regional competitions are connected to this in the sense that they act as qualification, I think the section could be considerably reduced - particularly now the regional competitions have less impact on new teams entering the league.

I think the Regional Tournament section ought to be vastly cut down, removing the table and leaving an overview of the qualification of teams from regional tournaments, a small table outlining teams that have qualified via this process and an in-text link to the various articles on the regional tournaments. By doing this you remove a great swathe of information that clogs up this article and that can be found elsewhere.

Another improvement to the article could be a rework of the table on previous WCL tournaments and adding an explanatory introduction to make it more comprehensive to the first time viewer.

76619a80d6162412,"""Age of consent 17-18==
I wanted about six months ago to add info that many states, at least 19 if I'm remembering correctly, have an age of consent of 17 or 18 but Flyer22 would not let me include the info next to the age range, only as a footnote. I think the information is important because simply stating the age range is 12-15 gives a misleading impression that all 50 states allow children 16 and older to consent to sex with adults, which is not true. Is it at all possible that the statement that not all states have an age of consent of 16 can be included next to the age range. I'm not edit warring I'm taking it to the talk page to see if I can get consensus.   
This matter was already settled after extensive debate. Refer to #Age of consent above. It wasn't about me not letting you do anything. It was about WP:Consensus being against you, and for valid reasons. I'm not about to repeat much of what was stated by me and various other editors on this matter. Furthermore, the lead is currently very clear that it's only the age range on the show that is designated as 12-15. I compromised more than enough with you on this. The current wording isn't even the agreed-upon consensus wording, but it is wording that I compromised with you on upon your return to Wikipedia. And once again, the lead of this article is not for mentioning age of consent laws, and your concern is no longer valid since the lead explicitly states """"on the program, the range is usually ages 12–15.""""   
It would only take one sentence to clarify that issue, its not like it would take a paragraph. And Malke's whole point against me was that the edit gave a false impression that the age of consent in the USA is 16. So I think its worth having one sentence clarifying that. Also I disagree that the lead should not mention laws, because the only reason the show exists is because these men are breaking the law.   
The issue is already clarified. And, like I stated, I am not repeating to you what was made explicitly clear to you by me and several other editors last year. Oh, and WP:LEAD is clear about what the lead should mention. Off-topic material is not a requirement or advised. And age of consent laws in the lead is off-topic.   
And changing the lead back to the contested, consensus-violation wording, which I again reverted, after you've repeated your contested view on this talk page, is something that you should never do. You should wait until the discussion is over. And if you see that the discussion is over, and you still haven't gotten your way, then too bad. We go by consensus when there's been a dispute that couldn't be settled between two or more editors, and consensus is clear on this. Do you think I'm suddenly going to agree with you? That is not going to happen, and, as stated, I've compromised with you enough on this. Your recent restoration of that contested edit is exactly what I was complaining to you about when I mentioned how you revert and revert, hoping to tire out the opposing editor and/or have the opposing editor finally agree with you. If I were to ask the Wikipedia community to weigh in on this again, the outcome would be the same. No doubt. So you need to move on from this discussion. See WP:DEADHORSE.   
I restored the note in a better way, """"age of consent varies by state"""", because it does. And this way it doesn't look like its editorializing, unlike the previous """"it should be noted in some states it is 17"""". The age of consent in Virginia is fifteen, for example, at least according to Hansen's book.   
Yes, you added the note in a way that still violates WP:CONSENSUS on the issue. Thank goodness Zadignose stepped in and reverted.   
I've just stepped into this conversation, at by the look of it there's been some edit warring over what looks like a non-issue. The text:

""""It was devoted to impersonating underage youth ranging from 11 to 15 years in age, and detaining adults who contacted them over the Internet for sexual liaisons.""""

Hi. I've reverted some of your edits on the article Samantha Harrison again, because I simply can't find any references for them.

You're new here, so I'll explain simply: for every article, especially for articles about living people, you need to provide a source for a stated fact. Put it another way - if Samantha Harrison came along to her own Wikipedia article and found something on it not to be true about her, we could get into a lot of trouble (see libel). If we have referenced that fact from another reliable source (say, a newspaper article or a website), then we are not to blame for any untrue information because it verified from another source (even if the source is untrue about the fact).

Samantha being a member of the Southern Districts Hockey Club is a fact, and even though it was not referenced by you, a quick Google search by me took me to a New Zealand Herald article stating her to be so, so I added that article as a reference to the fact. However, other facts added do not return anything useful for a reference, so we can't state them - I can't find anything about going to Cambridge, or her parents' divorce (which the latter is also irrelavent information).

If you can find a source, feel free to re-add the information with the source. Wikipedia:Citing sources has information on the basics of doing so.

Thanks  (mailbox)",0,0,0,0,0,0

 I'm not seeing what points readers to Hotchkiss in popular culture. Please clarify.

If the section is called """"Hotchkiss in Print"""" then maybe movie references are not appropriate here, or the section should be renamed.

As to your point about """"disgruntled alums:"""" Whether the quotations are positive or negative is immaterial. If they are references in print and they shed light on the history and reputation of the school, then the quotations seem entirely appropriate here. Would we want to include every last mention of Hotchkiss in the written record? Perhaps not. However, below are reasons for including quotes I have recently added (actually, re-added because they were removed at some point).

Thomas Hoving quotation: Hoving is one of the more notable alums, a longtime director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. As a public figure who is also an alum, his perspective on the school is significant. McPhee is also a leading writer of profiles and this piece originally appeared in the New Yorker. So, it's authoritative.

The Cullman quotation: I believe Cullman was chairman of the board of trustees, and the Cullman family has been one of the school's major supporters. Since Cullman is an alumnus and a prominent supporter, his comments on the school are worth noting.

Julian Houston is a judge in Massachusetts. As a successful legal professional, an alumnus, and a person of color, who has written a book that is clearly based on his experience at the school, it is appropriate to quote him on his time at the school.

Archibald MacLeish is among the school's most prominent alumni. Because of his stature, his comments on the school are notable.

Lemisch is both an alumnus and an emeritus history professor, who has written an article on the history of Hotchkiss. Because he is an alum and a historian, and because the subject of this article is the history of the school, a quotation from it is notable.

The above reasons support the relevance of these quotations to this article.

If there are other quotes by prominent alums who enjoyed their time at Hotchkiss, of course those would be worth citing here as well. """,0,0,0,0,0,0

77edd59733b7d224,"Liver Disorders
The liver is the second largest organ in your body and is located under your rib cage on the right side. It weighs about three pounds and is shaped like a football that is flat on one side. The liver performs many jobs in your body. It processes what you eat and drink into energy and nutrients your body can use. The liver also removes harmful substances from your blood. How does a healthy diet help the liver? Eating a healthy diet helps the liver to do its functions well and to do them for a long time.  Eating an unhealthy diet can lead to liver disease. For example, a person who eats a lot of fatty foods is at higher risk of being overweight and having non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. For people who have liver disease, eating a healthy diet makes it easier for the liver to do its jobs and can help repair some liver damage. An unhealthy diet can make the liver work very hard and can cause more damage to it. What does a healthy diet include? •Eating foods from all the food groups: grains, proteins, dairy, fruits, vegetables, and fats •Eating foods that have a lot of fiber such as fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grain breads, rice and cereals Are there diet changes for those with liver disease? It is important for people with liver disease to maintain a healthy weight by eating a balanced diet with foods from all food groups. Also, •Do not eat uncooked shellfish such as oysters and clams •Limit eating foods that have a lot of sugar or salt Liver Diseases and Diet Some liver diseases have specific diet recommendations: Bile Duct Disease Bile is a liquid made in the liver that helps break down fats in the small intestine. Bile duct disease keeps bile from flowing to the small intestine. Diet Recommendations: • Use fat substitutes • Use kernel oil (i.e. canola, olive, corn, sunflower, peanut, flax seed oils) because it needs less bile to break down fats than other types of oil Cirrhosis Cirrhosis is the scarring and hardening of the liver. Diet Recommendations: •Limit salt and foods that contain a lot of salt •Talk to your doctor about how much protein to have in your diet Fatty Liver Disease Fatty liver disease is the build up of fat in liver cells. Diet Recommendations: •Limit foods that are high in calories •Eat foods that have fiber Hemochromatosis Hemochromatosis is the build up of iron in the liver. Diet Recommendations: •Do not eat foods that have iron •Do not use iron pots and pans •Do not take pills with iron •Do not eat uncooked shellfish Hepatitis C Hepatitis C is a disease of the liver caused by the hepatitis C virus. Diet Recommendations: •Limit foods that have a lot of iron •Do not use iron pots and pans •Limit salt and foods that contain a lot of salt Wilson Disease Wilson disease is the build up of copper in the body. Diet Recommendations: •Limit foods that have copper such as chocolate, nuts, shellfish and mushrooms • Do not use copper pots •Limit eating fatty foodskawaljeet bhinder

Speedy deletion of Tom Cullimore
 A tag has been placed on Tom Cullimore requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia.

Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for biographies. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.

Good for you! Give yourself a pat on the back and proclaim """"yay me! I'm so smart! I can do it!"""" I'm glad to see such constructive work on your behalf. Always nice to see editors developing a sense of self-fulfillment from their work. This sentence will be inappropriately placed, but I feel that it is necessary; you need to learn to read carefully before editing and you should try to control your tendency towards behaviours that most would label as idiotic. No offense. Just trying to offer constructive advice for your benefit and for the sake of other editors that will have to deal with you. XJeanLuc (talk) 

I'm sorry that I must say this. I have never come across a more idiotic editor on Wikipedia. Congratulations on making it to the top of my list. I mean that in a congratulatory sense entirely; in no way is it meant to offend or sound sarcastic. I wouldn't call you an editor though. You're more of a pollutant to this project and one with extreme perversion of perception. Please reread the discussion at the talk page.

 baiting Paul

I think the consensus view is that we're not being arbitrary and we're not censoring; we have articles that say it had more Jews and are open to having articles report that Iran has far more Jews than the articles now say it has, provided it is verifiable to a source that trumps the actual, official, recent government census.  This has been discussed here and elsewhere, including talk pages linked to from this section (that is, #Iran).  The claims of a larger presence could be noted if, for example, there are verifiable sources that say that the numbers do not include significant numbers of Crypto-Jews living in Iran. (t•c)

Moxy, I get rudely rapped over the knuckles when I refactor. But you get away with it. Never mind, because in any event there seems to be a WP rule for everything, and a WP rule against everything. The real intellectual challenge seems to be to find a balance between the two, which nobody inluding myself seems able to do.
Re unsigned editor above: Thanks. You have been the very first editor to provide helpful criticism and guidance, which I believe is supposed to be the function of administrator. Usually my work is simply undone and reverted by admin and others without discussion; a kind of slap in the face. Talk about civility. Hmmm. Nice people. 
 Suggestion: instead of administrators and others engaging in endless displacement activity, why isn't anyone prepared to address the real issue around here, namely the primary issue I raised (again) at Reply to uninvolved intervening party which bears repeating: 
 WP:FRINGE, (and probably other wiki rules as well), states that: """"In general, Wikipedia should always give prominence to established lines of research found in reliable sources and present neutral descriptions of other claims with respect to their historical prominence (and) ideas should not be excluded from the encyclopedia simply because they are widely held to be wrong."""" Please note that the rule does NOT state: Wikipedia should always give prominence to established WESTERN lines of research found in reliable WESTERN sources."""" Yet this is exactly what the existing WW2 article does do. Not even one non-Western source is cited among the 340 odd sources cited .... 
 On my bookshelf right here beside me are no less that seven English language non-Western histories of WW2, some of them by Soviet historians. So there's no question about the existence of English language non-Western histories. These are considered reliable and established lines of research in their respective non-Western countries of origin, just as the Western sources cited in the article are considered to be reliable and from established lines of research in the West. Therefore both Western and non-Western positions should be reflected in the article, if it is to claim that it's NPOV, which it is not. Forget about all the efforts to discredit me, some of which are perfectly valid. Just address the issue at hand, namely POV bias through omission as repeatedly alleged by me, and which has resulted in a lot of displacement activity that seeks to evade the central issue of NPOV. Even or especially the intervening administrator has managed to evade the issue. The unsigned editor in this section admits that he has reliable access to history library resources so, if he has the time and inclination, maybe HE can come up with some reliable non-Western sources in the interests of NPOV, which everyone claims I'm contravening (among other things).

I am not very experienced in Wikipedia, but I feel this recent incident with the park ranger is a significant event, as important as him shouting baby killer at someone. The reason I believe this is that I have been the unpaid Park Ranger working the barrier and taking the abuse of the general public during prior shutdowns. Now, most of these people are frustrated and confused. They don't understand that it is not a decision the ranger at the barrier made, which is keeping them from entering, but a decision made by the leaders of the nation. When one of the leaders of the nation who caused the incident berates a person making barely above minimum wage, basically at one of the lowest levels of authority over that opening or closing decision, OVER AN INCIDENT HE HIMSELF CREATED that is an unprecedented level of hypocrisy and posturing for the cameras. He thought he'd look like a defender of the veterans, and fool people who couldn't reason well enough to realize he caused the very situation. He told that woman that SHE should be ashamed for doing her job as he and his fellow politicians directed. How dare he tell her to be ashamed for his actions? His cognitive dissonance level must be off the chart. It tells voters something EXTREMELY IMPORTANT about a person when he seeks office in the future.

A three-level abstraction is required here.  We have the history and strategy which are inseparable, and should be discussed in articles on each war or conflict.  That's the most abstract.  Then we need the least abstract military equipment and tactics level, with articles like military technology during the Napoleonic wars and so forth, to make it clear how conflicts were conducted using this stuff - this should focus on the actual tactical combat engagements, how they affected outcomes, etc..

And, for those wars that resulted in a great deal of change to military technology, either because they were very long (like the Hundred Years' War) or very intense (like WWI or WWII), we should discuss technological escalation as a separate topic, more abstract than the equipment and tactics, less abstract than history and strategy.  See technological escalation during WWI for an example - this can be done for WWII, US Civil War, Napeolonic wars, at least, as well, and maybe also for the Cold War.

Whether or not the language games are interesting or special around the world, gibberish is comonly reffered to both """"nonsense"""" as well as a form of code spoken by putting the first sound of every syllabol infront of -ida and the last part of the syllable onto the end of a """"g"""". For example, """"hi"""" would be """"hida gi"""" (hid-a-guy), and hey you would be """"hida gey yida gou.""""

I don't think that I'm the best authority to comment on this subject, but if no one else can help than feel free to copy and paste parts of this in.

I speak Gibberish

As does the person about me. I think the language should be mentioned here, because it is well spoken. There are many different types. I personally speak the form of -idiga, but there are forms such as -ither, -wither, and many others. If you need research help I would be glad to. I think the acutal spoken gibberish should be mentioned.  

How to speak Gibberish
All gibberish is, is you add the prefix """"idig"""" after the first syllable of the word. then speak the rest of the word. That is all you have to do. Easy as pie. Hello would become, hidigello.

The quote from Snitzler is very interesting in that it differs somewhat from Ramirez' version, but both are consistent with regarding it as a collaboration between Ramirez and Yepes. Collaboration can mean many things.

By both accounts this was a long, complex personal and creative relationship, of which each account is a mere snippet. Untangling them is interesting, but WP:OR and Wikipedia is not the place for it.

Ideas for improving the article
Great article. I took the liberty of replacing ˡ (U+02E1 MODIFIER LETTER SMALL L) in the article with ˈ (U+02C8 MODIFIER LETTER VERTICAL LINE) where it is used to indicate a stressed syllable. The former character is incorrect since although it appears as a vertical line in sans-serif fonts, it actually appears like a superscript lowercase l or a superscript 1 in serif fonts like Charis SIL and Doulos SIL. I only noticed this because I have a CSS hack that applies to all uses of the IPA template and forces a different font for them. I’m taking phonology at U. Hawaii at Mānoa so I’ll be sure to add anything interesting about Hawaiian that comes up. —  

Oh crap! Didn't even catch that.  I hope I haven't done it elsewhere.  

Well, like I said, I only noticed it because I have a CSS hack in place. I only wish that the rest of the world had the SIL IPA fonts installed... —  

Again, glad you like the article. The replacement symbol you used looked alright to me, but so did the original symbol. It's a stretch to claim """"[t]he former character is incorrect"""" on the basis of its appearance in fonts that 99.99% of users do not have. Most people have never heard of the Summer Institute for Linguistics. The character that I used to mark syllable stress is the one that Wikipedia presents for use in the IPA list of symbols below the edit box. So if you feel you have a """"better"""" symbol, then you should contact Wikipedians who are in a position to consider implementing your suggestion(s). You might try Brion Vibber. If you learn something new about Hawaiian phonology at UH, do let us know. But remember, Wikipedia does not want anything that is not already published. So if it's """"new"""", it might be unpublished, and therefore undesirable under Wikipedia policy.   

The font used to display the characters is unimportant. Their character encodings are specific. On the basis of the two Unicode names, I argue that U+02E1 MODIFIER LETTER SMALL L is inappropriate as the stress marker in IPA. Checking the appropriate Unicode chart on their website I find that U+02C8 MODIFIER LETTER VERTICAL LINE is listed under the section “Miscellaneous phonetic modifiers” with the comment “primary stress, downstep; precedes letter or syllable modified”. On the other hand, U+02E1 MODIFIER LETTER SMALL L is given in the section “Additions based on 1989 IPA” just below U+02E0 MODIFIER LETTER SMALL GAMMA which has the comment “these modifier letters are occasionally used in transcription of affricates”. So it’s fairly clear that the Unicode standard makes a distinction between their intended purposes. I note that in the bottom of the edit box the two are given in sequence, with U+02C8 immediately following U+02E1. It’s easily possible to press the first of the two accidentally. I will bring this up at m:Help talk:Special characters and ask someone to reorder them for clarity. —  

Your explanation and argument sounds good. I don't know the layout of the """"insert box"""" characters on other users' screens. When I edit, the IPA characters are displayed in two lines. The first line ends with tiny lowercase superscripts: h, w, a j-like character, gamma, """"lefty"""" glottal, n. The second line begins with the character I used for stress mark, followed by other stress marks, length mark, something too obscure to make out, a mid-height black square (apparently used to mark the end of a series of related symbols), and then the line ends with the double-curly-bracketed IPA. Based on your explanation, it appears that the first line of IPA characters is broken in a way that misled me into thinking that the last member of the series of superscripts is the first member of a series of stress marks. Bad line break. And there is no mid-height black square, nor significant white space, separating the superscript series from the stress mark series. Not seeing that previously, I used the first mark because it looks the same as the second, but darker. Of course, it also happened because a tiny superscripted sans-serif L looks nearly identical to a tiny superscripted vertical line.

If you have the motivation, maybe you can suggest more than just reordering in your communication with the Special Characters people. The addition of a separation character between the series of superscripts and the series of stress marks will help. Here's my best suggestion to offer on this matter - persuade the Special Characters folks to implement appropriate new text for the ho",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Format of quotations 

I've done some copyediting. In particular, there was a problem that a full stop was placed before a footnote, the footnote was added, and another full stop was placed after it. A few quotations had not been closed with quotation marks, etc.

Some quotations have are enclosed in   tags, which seem, according to my eye, to change them into italics but not to do anything else.  I don't see any reason to have some quotations in italics and some not. Actually, I don't see any reason to have any quotations in italics.  We've already had problems (in the Hitler article from which this section comes) with someome putting quotations that implied that Hitler was a fervent Christian in block quotes, and leaving the quotations that implied he was anti-Christian embedded in the text where they wouldn't look so obvious, and later saying that was done according to the length of each quotation (a claim which was refuted by a simple word count). I don't see a pattern in other articles of quotations being in italics.

I'm going to change all of the quotations to plain text (i.e. not italics).  Long quotations can, of course, go in block quotes, regardless of which POV they support. Unrelated to the issue of format is the use of the word """"deplored"""" in the last sentence. I propose changing that to """"rejected"""". """"Deplored"""" suggests shock and anger at the fact that this idea existed, rather than simply rejection of the idea. If I'm mistaken in this (as I don't know whether Hitler condemned the idea that Nazism was a religion, or the the idea that anyone would think it was), please change it back.  ♫ """,0,0,0,0,0,0

After reviewing the deletion, I think the error is technical.  I am on a Hughes Sat network that uses transparent proxies.  This was causing me to log in and out from page to page.  The original article which was not the correct article went through and posted when I switched to SSL wiki server.  This was unexpected, and as I was editing the article to the correct format it was deleted. (roughly 60-90 seconds from the originally post)   Due to this technical error the correct post was never entered into wiki.

This would have been the correct post if the article had not been deleting during editing and if I had not had technical issues which inadvertly caused me to post the incorrect format of the article.

This has been done under section G11 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article seems to be blatant advertising which only promotes a company, product, group, service or person and would need to be fundamentally rewritten in order to become an encyclopedia article. Please read our the guidelines on spam as well as the Wikipedia:Business' FAQ for more information. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.

Re the definition of what is obsolete, that is simple. Every concept is built based on some data. When new data have been obtained, the concept must either accommodate these data or explain why these data can be ignored. The concept that fail to do so is deemed obsolete. For instance, the early theory of the Universe claimed that the Universe is stationary. However, after discovery of the red shift by Hubble it became obvious that this theory is inconsistent with these data. Now this theory is believed to be obsolete.
The term """"archival revolution"""" is used by scholars to describe massive opening of formerly secret archives before western researchers. Obviously, the concepts that existed before this archival revolution, and the concepts that failed to take into account new data (accept of convincingly refute) are deemed obsolete now.

Do not accuse others of being vandals.  Because Ninlil's intervention did not seem partial to you, you have resorted to getting the page 'blocked from edits in the garb of it being an FA category (howsoever inaccurate' by Yellowmonkey.

Now whom should the question be asked: whether it is appropriate to mention the demise of the Cholas along with the demise of the Chalukyas, when it is clearly known to everyone that the Chalukyas first remained without a capital for over 30 years up to 1160/65 and finally demised in 1189/1192 AD with the Cholas lasting another 9 decades before being routed and finally eclipsed by the Pandiyans in 1279 AD?. This is simply because there is no relationship between the demise of the two kingdoms, the Cholas did not cause extinction of the Chalukyas or vice versa. The demise of the Chalukyas does not deserve mention in the Chola page even though the Cholas existed, but mainly because the Chalukyas were mainly consumed by their local rivals.  Then what could be the reason for mentioning the demise of the Cholas in the page of the Chalukyas who demised many, many years before them?

 Again, I am very grateful for the encouragement, but the way that EdJohnston has dealt with the matter (see his talk page for my complaint) simply shows me that mods and admins, in general, have a very biased view towards editors who simply wish to improve the quality of articles... present company excepted.
 I read with interest the candidate statements for the latest Arbitration Committee Election and one of them, a very senior Wikipedian, summed it up so aptly... """"We must clean our house, lest those who could advise and assist us dismiss Wikipedia as a nest of boobies. We should treat all editors alike. The best way to avoid being called a flock of juvenile loons is to stop acting like a flock of juvenile loons."""" Sadly, it is clear that prejudice and bias against some classes of contributors exists, and that the level of training, education and the ability to logically examine a conflict is woefully missing. It is inherently skewed.
 Although Ed has suggested referring the matter to the next level, it is clear, reading through all the Help pages, that Wiki has so many layers of arbitration, the complaint simply gets lost in the ensuing debate, and it then comes down to who is who in the Wiki org chart. The strap line that Wikipedia is the encyclopaedia that can be edited by ANYONE is a pie in the sky dream...it simply isn't true, as has been proven here. Looking through the dispute archives, there are tens of thousands of cases. Is it really worth it when more energy is expended in resolving obvious errors, and condoning poor attitude towards newbies, than in improving the site? So no, it can't be edited by anyone, it can only be edited by people who are approved, mates with other mods, or who make up false accusations and allegations against those who stand up to their incoherent and inaccurate edits. Quite sad really, as it could be quite good. But when there are people, like I've just encountered, who show no subject knowledge, logic, reasonableness, tolerance of new editors, and then blatantly lie to mods, to try and dig themselves out of their self-created holes, is it any wonder that people are leaving Wikipedia in droves (reading through complaint articles!)?  I came onto Wiki to contribute a few small lines to an article, about which I know an immense amount (I've been an RCVS patient for thirty plus years and have read the lot). But, the arrogance, unwelcome attitude, and air of """"keep off MY article"""" by a self-proclaimed (but unverified) medical 'expert' does little to encourage collation of information, let alone in the collaborative manner in which it is supposed to develop. At best, the experience of contributing to Wikipedia is eye-opening; at worst it is frankly shocking, and an almost bully-the-newbies-off mentality against anyone new who 'dares' to try and contribute. So, I wish you the best with it, but it is not the sort of self-grandising ego-centric cesspit of nastiness, and unnecessary argument that I wish to be a part. And do feel free to communicate this note to the upper echelons as yet another typical day in the life of a newbie contributor. Maybe, they may take note, but I doubt it very much, after all, too much ego is at stake in a majority of cases. Cheers! )""",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Aztec society 

Gidday Richard, I note that you've swapped some text about between Aztec society and Daily life in the Aztec Empire articles. I think it's fine to rationalise the arrangement on these topics, however I have some reservations about the latter of these two articles. It was one of a brace of Aztec and Maya articles (see for eg Mayan Trade, Mayan Food) all created around the same time in September by about 4 or 5 first-time editors, and they all have the hallmark of coming from some more extensive essay on the subject area. I'm not saying that there's copyvio involved here, my guess would be that it's almost like some joint class assignment has been broken up into separate articles. They are based on reasonable material, but they contain a number of evident misinterpretations and have more of a school essay feel to them. They need considerable work and rearranging, and in some instances I really wonder whether it is worth the effort as they cut across topics already covered in the main Aztec/Maya articles.

Just so as you know and something to bear in mind if distributing their contents across other articles. The images which came with the Daily Life article are also I believe mis-tagged as the contributor's own work, when clearly they seem to be taken from elsewhere. Anyways, keep up the good work, and cheers  | TALK """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Whilst I feel that this is probably diverting into a debate rather than discussing the article, I do think this reveals one of the fundamental flaws with this article.  It bases its observations, which IMHO verge at the very least on Original research, on how a particular country implements its digital TV system. For example, GeorgeFormby1 misses a great deal of context about the British situation which is relevant here, such as:
 Digital TV in the UK is strongly influenced by Freeview (and its soon to be launched sister Freesat), which are subscription free digital TV systems that the BBC (the UK's very dominant (compared to the US) public broadcaster is the key stakeholder in.  As pointed out by , Freeview boxes now retail at around £20 (actually around $40).  Although, it may seem a lot to pensioners in the US it is small compared to the annual, compulsory, Television licence fee of around £130per year ($260).
 Europe has traditionally had a much stronger regulatory framework with regards to broadcasting.  Where as, (if i understand correctly) in the US, cities are well served and rural areas often poorly served (in some cases having to pay to have affiliates and stations from other markets relayed to them so they can actually have a TV service at all), most of the traditional """"analogue"""" channels in the UK and Europe(in the UK: BBC1, BBC2, ITV, C4 and to a slighlty lesser extent Five, whose availability is constrained by the amount of bandwidth that was left in Europe by the time it started in 1997)  are obliged as part of their licence to be available universally i.e. In the UK, >98% coverage of the UK landmass.  This means that European airwaves tend to be very crowded and together with the stronger licensing rules means that there are relatively few analogue channels (UK homes get 4 or 5 channels, and 6 in a *small* number of cities, where (usually) community groups are given a *low* power licence.)
 The above therefore identifies the reason why a lot of European countries had an appetite for more channels when digital TV came along.  The restricted space available, particularly terrestrially, has meant that channels tend to be crammed into the available space, and indeed some digital channels have a very poor picture quality compared to a good analogue signal.  But this only tells half the story, implementations vary even in one country, for example in the UK compare the bit-rates of BBC1 digital are at about ~6Mbps compared to those on Mux A which run at <2Mbps (e.g. Five Life et al).  Thus, the resultant picture quality is purely down to the implementation,  that various multiplex owners have chosen to take and is not indicative of digital TV in general.  Indeed, as I understand in the US, where homes generally have a much greater number of channels but are """"afflicted"""" with the inferior NTSC system.  The application of digital TV has generally been to deliver HDTV as opposed to large quantities of new channels...
... and indeed that brings the question of what it is all for! In the UK and Europe large swathes of digital space are reserved for the public broadcasters (without getting into a debate over whether all this space is used for programming that is truely public service), post digital switch-over this will allow every home in the UK to access free-to-air and  terrestrially (the way most people receive TV in the UK) channels such as BBC Parliament (coverage of parliament), BBC News 24 (likely to be the UK's only free-to-air rolling news channel before long), BBC Four (""""high brow"""" arts and culture), Teachers TV (a channel for Teachers), etc, etc,.

 Military history WikiProject Newsletter, Issue I 

 The Military history WikiProject Newsletter Issue I - March 2006  Project news
 An independent military history peer review has been created for the benefit of the project.  A number of articles have already been reviewed, receiving significantly more feedback within the project than they did on the generic peer review page.
 The project's Collaboration of the Fortnight got off to a great start with Ferdinand Foch and is now focusing on the military history of Spain.
 Two new task forces—dealing with warfare during classical antiquity and the Middle Ages—have been created.
 An effort to build a catalogue of high-quality maps for use in military history articles is now underway.
 The newly-formed translation department is looking for volunteers to help with translating featured articles from other-language Wikipedias. From the Coordinators
Welcome to the inaugural issue of the Military history WikiProject's newsletter!  We hope that this new format will help members—especially those who may be unable to keep up with some of the rapid developments that tend to occur—find new groups and programs within the project that they may wish to participate in.  

Please consider this inital issue to be a prototype; as always, any comments and suggestions are quite welcome, and will help us improve the newsletter in the coming months.

, Lead Coordinator Current proposals
 Proposed guidelines for categories of military people are currently being discussed.  A number of issues have already been resolved, but the proposed scheme is still in draft form and further input would be very welcome.

 Protest against the unfair treatment and edits by user 'blueboy96'  

I am asking blueboy96 to act fair and do take the very same action against this usera person who is publicly slandering me for many months now.

You can delete info and people as you obviously do constantly, but you can never erase the true happenings. The truth.

It is 'beyond unacceptable' what 'Delicious Carbuncle' is doing. Did you, blueboy96 not realize that I only copied her display and changed the linksto blogs and websites that give the accurate information?!

Important Statement for Blueboy96 from Mark Bellinghaus

regarding his recent action of blocking me, another Wikipedia editorplease do not erase this, it shows the edits of Delicious Carbuncle in which she gave herself awayshortly after I called Pauline Berry, Delicious Carbuncle would edit messages and name the members of MARILYN MONROE PRODUCTIONS, LLC, within her edits. Read

May I add that if 'Blueboy96' looks at '[Delicious Carbuncle]'s' site and realized what a wonderful statement you can find, including the linksthat this is screaming for the very same action. Fairness is one thing, fooling people like Delicious Carbuncle has been doing it, another. She is Pauline Berry and if you check those two IP addresses I provided, you can see that they are leading to New Zealand, Pauline Berry's country of origin and from where she has been slandering me, Internet stalked me for the past three years.

She is fooling the entire Wikipedia community, she has built up a page for her band member, added herself to it, but she has several times tried to delete other sites with the claims which she broke herself. That is what HYPOCRITES do. If you think that this is offensive, then please watch what Pauline Berry has done, what she is supporting. My mom is Jewish and she is crying on the phone because her friends told her about one of the slanderous defamations where Delicious Carbuncle aka Pauline Berry has her hands in.

You haters, you people are sick sick sick people. You defraud the world with your fakes and then you lie to everyone's faces.

I called Pauline Berry in order to make her stop her sadistic and crazy attacks and the William Travilla support. Who else would cut the truth off from the William Travilla site which was edited professionally until Delicious Carbuncle put her dirty hands on it, again.

Who else would edit things like 'Don't call me' and name my friends and my nameif not Pauline Berry. Delicious Carbuncle gave herself away and then realized what she did and erased it fast. Edited over it. So, I ask you 'Blueboy96' to also disaple 'Delicious Carbuncle' who is defaming me for the past five months here on Wikipedia. If you want to remain fair, you must take the same actionwhich you used against me. Or I will file for an investigation in this matter. Fairness should be practiced here on Wikipedia. What you have done is unfair and it is a bias move. I have copied the info that is on Delicious Carbuncle's site about me and just switched links to her sick website and blogshe is supporting people who wanted to break into my home, who threatened me with AIDS infected blood. Do you really think this is funny or something?

Here is my statement and I am asking for immediate action. Delicious Carbuncle is Pauline Berry. She can a million times claim that she is notbut we have caught her in too many lies in the past. She is actively supporting several frauds, she was attacking whenever we made another successful exposure.

This is a statement regarding your block. First of all, I am the one who has been Wikipedia stalked for over one year now by none other than Delicious Carbuncle, who gave messages through her edits. She followed every single edit and deleted EVERYTHING. She is Pauline Berry and I can provide her IP address if you do not believe me.

She has been too obvious for everyone. I am not accusing her, I have disproved her already with facts. She has absolutely and completely supported and defended the William Travilla exhibition fraud which we exposed to the public as being a 100% criminal fraud. She edited out the facts on the William Travilla page, added links to her friend's website, which is also a commercial website, Melinda Mason who sold copyright infringed DVD's on eBay.

Next stopthe VANITY FAIR hoax. Delicious Carbuncle started a Wikipedia page for Millington Conroy, after I exposed him for being a forger who fooled the magazine with his fakes.

I am being blocked for telling the truth? Delicious Carbuncle is defaming me on her page, you did not see this?

She claims that her interest is not focused on Marilyn Monroe and or memorabilia? Her edits are telling a different story. Next the Name of the Rose. She followed me twic",0,0,0,0,0,0

80964bc23ecd4a50,""":Thanks Tom - that's a much better summary than the previous one. One question: in the comparison of UKIP's performance to that of other parties, I think saying that the SNP polled less than UKIP could be misleading for non-UK readers. If I didn't know that the SNP only stood candidates in Scotland, I'd get the impression from the current text that UKIP did much better than the SNP on average. But knowing that UKIP put up candidates across the country (while the SNP didn't) gives quite a different impression, since, of course, the SNP polled much better than UKIP everywhere it put up candidates. So for the benefit of non-UK readers, in the section comparing UKIP's performance to that of the Lib Dems and SNP, perhaps it might be helpful to add """"ahead of the Scottish National Party (who only contested seats in Scotland)""""?

I won't make that addition unless you approve, though.

Oh, one more thing - do we have a quote from a UKIP official or UKIP press release on the official reaction to the election result, or a link to an article about it? It would be interesting for readers to see what 'spin' the party put on what might otherwise be regarded as quite a disappointing result for them.

 Land Day   /Jewish Exodus    

The background of the former is completely skewed, as you note. The latter article is premised on a wholly ideological POV attempt to establish a symmetry between the expulsion of Palestinians, and the far more, and much later (generally) exodus of Jewish communities from the Arab world. The Arabs did not encourage Palestinians to leave. Zionists strongly encouraged the Jewish diaspora in the Arab world to make aliyah. As it stands, of all I/P articles, the Jewish exodus registers as the one which narrates almost exclusively an Israeli/Zionist POV. Quite remarkable. This is how Shlomo Ben-Ami puts it, in his review of .

In October of that year, on the eve of Operation Hiram, which led to the expulsion of many of the Arabs of the northern Galilee region, Ben-Gurion declared, """"The Arabs of the Land of Israel have only one function left to them  to run away."""" And they did; panic-stricken, they fled in the face of massacres in Ein Zeitun and Eilabun, just as they had done in the wake of an earlier massacre in Deir Yassin. Operational orders, such as the instruction from Moshe Carmel, the Israeli commander of the northern front, """"to attack in order to conquer, to kill among the men, to destroy and burn the villages,"""" were carved into the collective memory of the Palestinians, spawning hatred and resentment for generations. 

There are only two points on which Morris' splendid analysis falters. He is unconvincing in his attempt to pardon some of Israel's original sins by creating an awkward symmetry between the Palestinian refugee crisis and the forced emigration of 600,000 Jews from Arab countries and Iran, which Morris quotes Israeli leaders as calling """"an unplanned 'exchange of population.'"""" Regimes hostile to Israel were not alone in getting Jews to leave; envoys from the Mossad, Israel's intelligence agency, and from the Jewish Agency were working underground in several Middle Eastern countries to encourage Jews to go to Israel. More important, for many Jews in the region, the very possibility of immigrating to Israel was the culmination of millenarian dreams. It represented the consummation of a quest to take part in Israel's resurgence as a nation. No matter how painful the memory of their eviction or how humiliating their second-class status in Israel, these new Israelis never sought to return to their lands of origin. By contrast, the Palestinian refugees were forced into the wilderness of exile with no guarantee of a new national home and no prospect of returning to their native land. The yearning for return thus became the Palestinians' defining national ethos. 
Morris' characterization of the conflict of 1948 as an Islamic jihad against Jewish-Western infidels in Palestine is also unpersuasive. It is true that the figurehead of Palestinian nationalism at the time was the fanatically religious and viscerally anti-Semitic mufti of Jerusalem, Haj Amin al-Husseini. And Arab discourse during 1948 was occasionally peppered with the rhetoric of holy war: the Syrian author Vadi'a Talhuq's book A New Crusade in Palestine, published on the eve of the Arab invasion, compared the war to the liberation of Palestine from the crusaders. Yet Israel in 1948 was no tool of the West. On the contrary, it could not have won the war without arms shipments from the Soviet bloc. The socialist nature of Israeli society at the time prompted Egypt's prime minister, Mahmud al-Nuqrashi, to define Israel as an agent of """"atheism and nihilist Communism."""" And the Zionists' Arab enemies were hardly under the control of Islamic movements. They were all ruled by decadent conservative elites who paid nothing more than lip service to Islamic values and the religious hysteria on the Arab street. Broadcasters and agitators rallied the masses under the banner of a holy war against the nascent Jewish state. But the Muslim Brotherhood sent only one battalion to fight in Palestine. It was ill-trained conventional armies, not Hezbollah-style guerrilla units, that led the Arab assault in 1948. After the defeat, rather than pursuing jihad against Israel, the conservative Arab regimes signed an armistice agreement granting legitimacy to Israel's 1948 borders. And between 1949 and 1952, they all attempted to reach permanent peace agreements with the Jewish state.  Shlomo Ben-Ami A War to Start All Wars, Foreign Affairs, September/October 2008.

 Not to worry...jdorney will not be with Wikipedia much longer. 

I have proved time and again that the corrections I make are 100% accurate and verifiable. I have gone out of my way to provide detailed information on sources and where those sources can be located. In contrast the sources quoted by Jdorney are not only dubious, but are not at all supported by the majority of authors and historians. Jdorney uses two main sources...CAIN and Lost Lives. CAIN is a """"estimation"""" at best, and the US State Dept. Jane's Intelligence, British  Human Rights Watch, the Council On Foreign Relations, and various books and articles...all take issue with CAIN's facts and figures. As for Lost Lives, I have the latest edition of that book, and Jdorney completey fabricates the figures. If one reads carefully from 1969-2005, they see the number given as 86, shown as the amount of UDA and UVF members killed by IRA and INLA units. 85% of that number are given credit soley to the IRA. I wonder if jdorney even has the book, since he misquotes it so often. Similar numbers I have provided as to the number and units of British and Irish killed by the IRA is similarly backed up by Lost Lives...if one actually takes the time to read it throughly. I am not going to respond to any more whiney, and childish messages by jdorney. I have informed Wikipedia staff about his biased and unprofessional behavior, and have recieved back that Wikipedia will look into it. It is sad that Wikipedia has to be hampered by a few biased, purposely innacurate Editors, who ignore facts and make up their own...just to support their own one sided views.

PS. Jdorney can leave more messages for me if he wants, but I will not respond to them, and all will be forwarded to Wikipedia staff for review.

I will also continue to monitor the IRA article and this article, to ensure that the correct facts are not continually changed, by a editor, who I doubt will be with Wikipedia much longer:)""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Dan56 seems to bully people into his POV.  he tends to prefer old-school artists, but also Kanye.  He hates Nicki Minaj.  He reverts and """"fixes"""" anything that he doesn't agree with personally, then rallies around a few cronies to agree with him on talk pages.  I've checked- he reaches out and tells them basically what to say.  On Nicki Minaj's page, he wanted to make her """"negative"""" so used Metacritic to say her reviews were just """"mixed.""""  On Aaliyah's page, becuse he likes her, he said """"metacritic"""" is  not the""""end-all.""""  Frankly, the guy's full of shit, and must have all day to just bully good-faith editors around.

 More about Barriers 

The second paragraph presently begins: Study tech attempts to remove what it calls """"barriers to study"""".  Study Tech defines 3 barriers.  As a dictionary defines words and as biology defines the cell """"nucleus"""" and the """"cell membrane"""", well, Study Tech defines 3 barriers which it says exist.  It says, """"there are three barriers to study"""", that is its message.  It spells out the barriers and it says how to deal with these barriers when a student encounters them.  Could we have Study tech defines three barriers to study and purports a methodology of dealing with them?

Responses:
I have made no """"legal threat"""" to anyone. It is a matter of an apparent breach  of a moral obligation by Sven Manguard to me. I worked hard with Wikimedia Australia over a three-month period to develop an idea in great detail, which is complex and has many original elements. I conveyed some of the details to Manguard after he assured me he had no intention of developing anything remotely similar. I was then told by a third party that """"Sven grabbed me on IRC to tell me he is planning a similar project"""" and that Sven had said """"well, I'm going ahead with it"""". Manguard has since said on my talk page, """"you missed your chance, your partnership fell through, and if there is even the slightest chance of it coming to fruition, it's not going to be for several more months. I'm not going to drop my efforts, and I'm not going to wait indefinitely for something that at this point I'm pretty sure is never going to happen ..."""". Actually, the partnering institution had already agreed in principle, and there has simply been a delay in implementation. I have been led to believe that others in the WMF have been apprised of the idea; but I'm in the dark as to what level of detail he has divulged, and whether clearly identifiable details of my scheme have been or will be duplicated without attribution. If distinctive and original details are being conveyed contrary to his undertaking to me, it is a moral breach; and if they are implemented without attribution to me, that is also a moral breach; if this occurs, I believe I have a moral right to inform people of it. This is the gist of what I said to Manguard, but now I'm been accused of making """"legal threats""""; this is based on a complete misunderstanding. In fact, I don't have a legal foot to stand on in that respect, and he knows it. Why is this being construed as anything """"legal""""? For all we know, Manguard's ideas might be quite different; but he needs to communicate them as a courtesy as much as a practicality.I was the person who suggested publicly that Manguard and Adam be """"directors"""" at FSC, only a few weeks ago. I believe Manguard has done good work there, so I don't understand why this spin-out is happening. It has quickly morphed into accusations of """"gross incivility, threats of off-wiki harassment, and personal attacks"""". I see no evidence of gross incivility by me (aside from an unkind thing I said on his talk page yesterday—""""not mature enough""""—which I'm willing to withdraw), nor of personal attacks. Instead, I have endured major and repeated personal attacks on his and my talk pages. No one has mentioned those.This seems to have been mixed up with complaints about my reviewing at FSC: they are surely two different issues. If people are troubled by professional reviews of soundfiles, I think there's a big problem for features sounds. I have presented factual evidence and what I believe are balanced opinions, and have supported a few WP-produced files, too. I encourage WPians to present their own performances for FS promotion, just as our photographers do at FSC, but please let's review them professionally without fear or favour.  (talk) """,0,0,0,0,0,0

One would not be incorrect to label Lana, Hornswoggle, and El Torito as wrestlers.

Lana is obviously in a feud with Summer Rae (as an offshoot of the Ziggler-Rusev feud), she has brawled with Summer, and it's apparent that it's leading to a match between the two (either one-on-one, or a mixed tag with their respective fellas).  And the women should be given more leeway regarding this issue compared to the men anyway, as they don't wrestle nearly as many matches as the guys do (1 diva match - MAYBE 2 if they're lucky - per card)

Lana is no longer just a wall flower who stays on the outside.

And Torito and Horny have wrestled a ton of times.  Granted mostly as comedy acts and not serious competitors, but they've wrestled plenty, and are not merely sidekicks.

Metalcore is a modern fusion of both hardcore punk and heavy metal. Metalcore is known for its emphasis on breakdowns and heavy guitar riffs. Screamed vocals dominate metalcore. Singing is usually present, but the emphasis is on screamed vocals. A lot of bands that are casually referred to as """"hardcore"""" or """"metal"""" are actually metalcore bands. Metalcore has practically taken over the heavy metal music scene.
Screamo is one specific derivative form of hardcore punk. It has nothing to do with heavy metal. It denotes a fusion of hardcore punk and emo, generally featuring emotional lyrics, transitions from soft to heavy passages, and screamed vocals accompanied by more melodic singing. The word screamo is misused all the time. People often call any music with screaming in it """"screamo"""". But screamo is actually only one specific genre. The genre itself is still very popular. There are lots of modern screamo bands that more-or-less still meet the same basic stylistic requirements of screamo.
Post-hardcore is a direct derivative of hardcore punk (hence the title post-hardcore). It simply defines any modern hardcore punk with high levels of experimentation. I know you didn't ask about this genre, but I felt it appropriate to mention. Post-hardcore represents a very wide range of musical styles. Post-hardcore bands may take influence from many other styles of music, and are often closely associated with alternative rock or punk. What identified post-hardcore, though, is the inclusion of hardcore punk elements like screamed vocals. If a band uses screamed vocals and heavy instrumentation, but is not heavy enough to be considered metalcore, then the band will often be labeled post-hardcore. 90.205.53.223  ericdeaththe2nd90.205.53.223  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 I have also reinstated this statement which they removed from the first para: """"The need for planetary protection measures is strongest for missions designed to return a sample from another planet or celestial body to the Earth (back-contamination)."""" again without discussion.

Dohn, see my reply to Powers about Google searches, above. I regard these as crucial for our titles to take into account. That is how many web users encounter our articles; Google knows that, and gives our titles great prominence. This is not understood well by WP editors.
I consider the behaviour of WP's own search prompts important, even if these are a second consideration after Google has been taken into account. Under """"my scheme"""" in its completeness, or some scheme that I would accept, one might type as far as """"Catholic Memorial"""" and get a better, more comprehensive DAB page that would include several that are not readily findable now. As things stand, prompts show a couple of DAB pages with identical content (is that kosher?), and two specific article pages: for Massachusetts and Wisconsin. Under the proposal in this RM, it is hard to say how things might go. Not usefully for the reader, as far as I can see.
I regret that because of commitments in the world at large I have little time to take this further (though I have, you will agree, commented in detail already; thanks to you, for doing the same). For me the essential point is broad. I don't really care about individual cases of confusion arising from bad RMs; I would like to see a more sophisticated understanding of titles generally, for our millions of articles.

As unworldly as it is now, we can just imagine how it would look if it were to be factually comprehensive. We need to break down """"Jewish Communities"""" into lists with more specified criterias. 

 This list - being something that technically doesn't belong in the List of Jewish communities in North America (because a Kollel is not a yeshivot, Hebrew schools or a  synagogue) - is a great start to more useable and specific list of """"Jewish Communities"""".  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Curious but unreferenced

Pig War is curious and has a great potential! that is, the article. Two words of note:
 Don't insert links to wikipedia articles in footnotes. Use direct links to actual sources (or reference to printed sources). A reference linking just """"Statistik Austria"""" makes an impression of a fake ref, and few people will care to explore the subject in depth. These will be reverted on sight.
 Have some consideration as to where you insert links to the article. Some of these look like spamming. The 1906 affair has little relevance for post-war Austria - the economic growth after the Anschluss and the destruction of 1945 were orders of magnitude higher than any event preceding WW1.

 Comment from IP 

I was a Sophmore in High School when the 37th division was sent to the South Pacific theater of war. Three years later, in May, 1945, I was a replacement joining this Division where I earned my combat badge in June of that year. June 30th did not see the end of combat for this Division. I was an 18yr. old replacement and a member of Company D, 145th Infantry Regiment when we were sent deep into the Cagahan(Sp?) Valley of Northern Luzon with the assignment to thwart the fleeing soldiers of Japan from reaching the dense forested hills bordering that Valley. Our Company was engaged in many firefights with these retreating Japanese army units. My last combat missions were ended soon after the Dropping of the atomic bombs on the Japanese main land in early August. While my combat experience was very limited, I did come face-to-face with my own mortality during these few months of combat experience. When I came home in 1946, I remember the resentment I felt that my parents had to come with me before I could register to vote in my first National election. I was still under the legal voting age of 21.

On another subject, the Name of Medal of Honor winner, John J. Petrarcal is new to me. There is a famous ballad about the only Medal of Honor Winner about whom I had ever read, and that Medal of Honor went to Pvt.Roger Young, 148 Infantry Division,37th Division  for bravery on the Island of New Georgia, in the Solomon Islands in May of 1942.

I in no way want to detract from John Petrarcal, but I wonder, are there possibly two heroes to recall?   Citations: Personal experience and 37th Division written History.

Invitation and Recommendations for writing articles on Hindi Wikipedia

Hindi wikipedia invites and welcomes Wikipedians to contribute for the cause of spreading knowledge and the Hindi language. This page contains guidelines for writing a wiki-article on any topic at the Hindi Wikipedia, with special recommendations for writing in Hindi (Note: The script/font-family for Hindi is Devanāgari; the script/font-system for English is Roman script, also, the Hindi spelling system is not completely standardized). This article is yet in English language (mostly), in order to encourage even non-native/foreign people who have learnt/are learning Hindi to contribute to the Hindi wikipedia, and native Hindi speakers who normally write in English. The examples given below are only for explanation.

Recommendations:
Firstly for proper viewing, it is recommended to keep all links NOT-UNDERLINED. Otherwise the मात्रा below the Hindi alphabets might get partly hidden behind the underlines. For this, please go to My Preferences (मेरी पसंद) at the top of the page, then click Misc., and then choose """"underline links -> Never"""". Save your settings. Also, do not click yes for """"justify paragraphs"""", otherwise on some browsers, the devanagari script will appear highly distorted.
All users are requested and encouraged to contribute articles here, especially, to create new articles on general topics. They are also encouraged to expand the existing articles, and improve upon them. A non-user can also do the same; it is recommended but not required to register yourself as a wikipedian user at the Hindi wikipedia. As far as possible, each article should be written with a Neutral Point of View (NPOV)—no nationalistic or partiality or hatred based articles are welcome. The articles should be based on facts—and appropriate references should be provided as and where needed. See the English wiki's help page for editing in general. Almost all the general wiki-features are available for editing on Hindi wiki too. Guidelines for the content matter is mostly the same as given in English wiki.
Since the Hindi wiki is at its initial stages, users are welcome to take introduction and basic points from the English (or another) wikipedia's corresponding article and translate them for small articles. An in-page link to the English wiki's article will be deemed sufficient for references (a template might be created stating this). For longer articles, it is recommended to mention the references separately. 
Since most computer users in India and elsewhere have the standard Western-type keyboard, it is best recommended (but not necessarily required) to use the virtual (software) keyboard like the one of Hindimozhi or of ISIS (Tavultesoft Keyman)—which are freewares. These are advantageous because the contemporary Hindi-speakers in India often write messages/chat using Hindi words but written in Roman (English) script, and the layout of these keyboards is quite the same that such people use. For example, using the """"normal"""" keyboard with this software, typing ga would give ग and ghaa would give घा.
Create the article with its name written in Hindi (devanagari script). Always take care to include the nukta (dot below) for foreign / Urdu loanwords wherever it occurs in the standard spelling. For non-Indian names, use that spelling (for article name and other words) which is commonly encountered in Hindi newspapers, G.K.-books, Hindi-dubbed TV documentaries and Hollywood films and magazines. e.g., America-अमरीका (या अमेरिका), China-चीन, French-फ़्रांसिसी. For English acronyms/short-forms, use the initials in Roman script, and again create a full form in Hindi and redirect it to the short form. e.g. IPA (अन्तर्राष्ट्रीय ध्वनि वर्णाक्षर); UNO (संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघ). Doing the opposite is also fine. But creating the article with the Hindi short form, as सं०रा०सं०, is not recommended. Also, the article proper must be written with the proper nukta, as फ़ारसी, and then, a non-nukta (mis-)spelt version फारसी should preferably be created to redirect to the correct spelling.
Hindi wikipedia strongly recommends the users to write articles in everyday common Hindi in the खड़ीबोली dialect (Hindustani or Hindi-Urdu, i.e., बोलचाल वाली हिन्दी, which may include many loanwords from Persian and Arabic). The use of शुद्ध संस्कृतनिष्ठ हिन्दी  is in general neither required nor recommended. E.g., use: वजह instead of कारण, ख़ास instead of विशेष, वगैरह instead of इत्यादि, लेकिन instead of परन्तु etc. However, for technical and specialized vocabulary, the use of शुद्ध संस्कृतनिष्ठ हिन्दी  is recommended and usually",0,0,0,0,0,0

If you think you can do the references better, go ahead. I challenge you. Don't tell me to """"have it my way""""  as though you are doing me a favor; you are not. If you think you can do the article better, go ahead, I would like to see it.

The reason I handled the references that way is that it seems to me to be the most convenient for the reader (and other editors), which is all I care about. If that pisses other editors off (and how many other editors would that be?), it says something about them, not about me. I have no interest in """"owning"""" an article. But I have worked long and hard to do a good job and deserve to have my work treated with respect, which BMK has certainly not done. Just look at the section above titled """"Wallack's Theatre."""" 

Rewrite the article to your heart's content; just make sure you are improving it. The claim that I think I own the article is BMK's complete fiction. If you look at the record, you will see that I have welcomed constructive changes. But Wikipedia has a rule about collegiality and collaboration. Making many and significant changes to someone else's work without discussing it with him is not collaboration, it is contemptuous. Look  how I interacted with him here (under cul-de-sac). Do you think I deserve to be treated the same way? I do.

Just try to change an article that BMK has edited. I have  and have almost always been immediately reverted, even though in most cases it turned out I was right. And these instances do not concern matters of taste; they concern matters of fact. This has happened many times  most recently here (by coincidence, on October 3rd). So BMK has a double standard: one for him, and the opposite for me (and presumably everyone else). I give respect to those who give me respect; most often I have been treated by him with dismissive disdain.

The reason I blanket-reverted his changes (I didn't even look at them) is only that: that his way of going about editing my article was contemptuous. He reminds me of Lucy kicking down Linus' sand castles in Peanuts. I was not objecting to the content of his changes (although I do, to some of them), but to the process. Observe how Moonriddengirl did it: She discussed the issues on the article's Talk Page first  and I had no trouble making the changes. Is it too much to expect BMK to do the same?

As for Footnote 1, that was someone else's contribution, as the record shows (see the history at 26 June 2013); I merely relocated it to where I thought it was more appropriate. And notice how I politely explained to that editor on the Talk Page what I did and why  and said I hoped he agreed. If you think the article is better without it, delete it (you might want to explain the reason for doing so to that contributor, as he deserves an explanation).

And speaking of original research, you might want to have a look at the edit war here (discussed above in the section """"Madison Square depot"""") and explain to me how the note I added constitutes """"original research"""" and is therefore unacceptable. And how about the edit war here. Can you explain BMK's behavior in that case? (And notice that BMK began editing my article again for the first time in two months on October 2nd, right after these three exchanges  Madison Square depot, the map image, and the categories. Could it possibly be spite?)

The problem is not me; for a year I have been a conscientious editor, and carefully sensitive to the feelings of others, including BMK. But although we have occasionally had cordial exchanges, for the most part, I did not receive similar treatment in return. And now he is completely misrepresenting me and our history. And when I say so  to protect myself  your response is, """"Come on.""""   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

They debate whether he preached the imminent end of the world, his connection to religious groups (such as the Essenes), and which sayings attributed to him are actually his.

So, that reference just cannot be made.

Let us wait how that turns out.

IF SUPREME COURT HAS stopped that report being submitted in Parliament yet, respect the SUPREME COURT of INDIA and dont post any findings of ANY commission here before it is tabled in parliament.

so, that and especially the widely believed conspiracy theory that RSS and BJP etc started the riots by blaming Muslims just cannot stand. Such a statement is just not admissible. Anyone can then write any conpiracy theory and pass it off as widely believed and truth etc.

Wide """"beliefs"""" like this just cannot be written.
You need proof just as when you deleted that Muslims burnt Hindus. If that cannot be written then the POV that it was a Hindu conspiracy is patent nonsense and cannot be tolerated.

 re: Intermediawiki linking 

re: (My talk) First off: please don't get mad at me for what I say below. I say it in good faith, and most likely a naive view.It seems to me that you're going about interwiki-linking to the other wikimedia sites in an overly complex way. Wouldn't something along the same style as the inter-language wikipedia links (i.e. in the bar on the left of the page) be far better, and much more elegant? Not only would it reduce the amount of clutter on the page, it would also remove any issues with categories being named differently as the interlanguage links deal with this as a routine matter. Additionally, there are a number of bots that would be able to propagate these interwiki links (i.e. you'd add one set of links on, say, Wikipedia, and a bot could propagate them to all of the other sites).

I can see two issues with this: 1. it requires developer changes to the mediawiki code, 2. it's not possible to use tracking categories. Hopefully the first one of these shouldn't be too difficult to arrange, and if inter-wikimedia-ing becomes popular, I think that the benefit of the tracking categories is fairly minimal. ... or am I misunderstanding what you're doing? The above works nicely if you're just linking similar templates together, and even if you're making sure that they have similar functionality. However, if you're making sure that all of the templates _are exactly the same_, it's not so good. In this case, a system like that used at Help:Link would be better - having a single master copy (the best place I can see for this is on the meta), which is then copied over to all of the mediawiki wikis every so often. That copying could be done by a bot, say every 24 hours, with the template being flagged for human attention if it's been modified anywhere but on meta. Of course, extra care would then have to be taken if the template calls were modified.  ''

Mike I be putting this whole section in WT:TSP, but the short answer is first that I concluded last fall this belongs on Meta, and much of our 'good stuff' is already there and many of our best template programmers contribute there as well (Omegatron, CBD, etc.) But here people know me and so this is where it began. Like David, RL called (demanded!) and I went wiki-missing much of last fall, and was busy with mediation stuff when I first returned to having regular time for wiki's, then iterwikitmp-grp hit Tfd... so that boot in the rear restarted things. I'd really rather be working on categorization between here and the commons! Sigh... life is not a selection of first choices, most of the time we're lucky to be able to get one selection in our top fifteen!  I'll address your points on WT:TSP. But thanks for the interest and input. I like that idea of intersister interwiki's! As for 'What I'm doing', the WP:TSP has new revision that may help communicate the focus as I see it. This is really a local need as much as one off in the smaller sister's though Wikispecies and Wikiversity much need template expertise and libraries.  ttfn // nkB """,0,0,0,0,0,0

In original Chess, I have the option to either castle king-side or queen-side when there are only Rooks and King on the back rank.  But now, if I have this start position of 946 or 947, I have to move a rook.  Are there official rules out there by FIDE or USCF that explain what to do here?  If we are to be faithful to the original Chess setup, then castling must be allowed either way I would think.  Instead, we now have to move a rook away in order to castle queen-side, and it's only for roughly 2 (maybe more?) initial setups.  I think what you said should be explained in a new subsection of the castling rules.  Like, in original chess, I have people argue about En Passant, and I have an official place I can point to and tell them that En Passant is a real move.  Now if 946 or 947 arise, they may either try to do a null move, or they may force me to move a rook (if a null move is allowed).  This seems like either a flaw or something that should be outlined in the rules specifically.  If it is the case where the rook must move first, then I think a new subsection should be added to explain this. )",0,0,0,0,0,0

You further go on to say that """"Once completed, the dam was managed by Roy Sherlock until the 1970's.""""

Although I cannot contest the second statement, I cannot agree with the contention in the first sentence.  It may be that Stephen """"Roy"""" Sherlock worked on the construction of the Sennar (Makwar) Dam.  However Pearson's Contract Agent was my grandfather, John Watson Gibson.   

The entry for the Sennar Dam gives a reference to:  O. L. Prowde, The Gezira Irrigation Scheme, Including the Sennar Dam on the Blue Nile, Minutes of Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers, Vol. 222, p. 80 (1926).

Page 96 of that document contains the following:

The scheme was designed by Sir Murdoch MacDonald, M. Inst. C.E., Adviser to the Egyptian Ministry of Public Works.  He also exercised control over the carrying out of the work until his retirement from the Egyptian Government Service in 1921.
The consulting engineers were the late Sir A. L. Webb, M. Inst. C.E., from 1914 until his death in 1921, and Messrs. Coode, Fitzmaurice, Wilson, and Mitchell, from 1922 to the present date.
Colonel L. N. Cooper, M. Inst. C.E., was appointed resident engineer in 1914, followed by Mr. E. W. Buckley from 1914 to 1917. The Author has held that office from 1917 to the present date.
The contractors from 1919 to 1922 were the Sudan Construction  Company (Messrs. E. Alessandrini and G. S. Perry, M. Inst. C.E.).  From 1922 to the completion Messrs. S. Pearson and Son,  Ltd., carried out the work. Their director in charge was Sir Frederick T. Hopkinson, M. Inst. CE., the agent in charge being Mr. J. W. Gibson.
The sub-contractors for the supply and erection of the sluice steelwork were Messrs. Ransomes and Rapier, Ltd., of Ipswich, their engineer in charge being Mr. J. R. Russell.

On this basis I propose to amend the entry accordingly.

David Ernest Duke (born July 1, 1950) is a former Louisiana State Representative and former leader of the Ku Klux Klan.

He has made a number of unsuccessful political bids for higher office, including run for the Louisiana State House, Louisiana State Senate, United States Senate, United States House, governor of Louisiana and twice for president of the United States. In 2002 he pled guilty to tax evasion and fraud charges. He is a long-time New Orleans resident and the proud father of Erika and Kristin Duke. 

Youth & Early Adulthood, the Klan and first campaigns

David Duke was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma to David H. & Maxine Duke. As a Shell Oil engineer his fathers frequently moved his wife, David, and his sister Dotti to numerious locations around the world. The Duke's spent a short period of living in the Netherlands before they settled in Louisiana. Young David became interested in the white nationalist movement at an early age and joined the Klan in 1967. Duke went on to study at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge and in 1970, he formed a caucasian campus-group known as the White Youth Alliance. That same year, he made himself known even more by demonstrating in swastika regalia to protest William Kunstler's appearance at Tulane University, LA. He was involved in the campus ROTC, until he was kicked out due to his radical beliefs. In 1971, he went to Laos to teach English to Laotian military officers and serve on cargo flights for Air America over the course of ten weeks.

Duke returned to LSU, graduating in 1974. He became notorious on campus for wearing a Nazi uniform, Ku Klux Klan apparel, and swastika paraphernalia while picketing and holding parties on the anniversary of the birth of Adolf Hitler. The year of his graduation, he was elected Grand Wizard of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. He attracted attention for trying to modernize the Klan and turn it into a modern nationalist political force. For example, he changed the title of 'Grand Wizard' to 'National Director' and sported a conservative suit as opposed to the traditional white robe. 

In 1976, Duke sought a seat in the Louisiana State Senate as a Democrat. In 1978, he left the Klan and two years later formed the National Association for the Advancement of White People (NAAWP). In 1987, he conducted a direct-mail appeal using the identity and mailing-list of the Forsyth County Defense League, in Georgia, without permission, which League officials described as a fund-raising """"scam"""" (detailed in The Rise of David Duke by Tyler Bridges). In 1988, he ran in the Democratic Party primary for President of the United States. After a dismal showing in the Democratic primaries, he appeared on many state ballots as the nominee of the Populist Party and received  approximately 25,000 votes in the 1988 general election.

Using the pseudonym Dorothy Vanderbilt, Dr. Duke published a self-help book for women titled Finders-Keepers in 1976. The publication gives advice to women regarding vaginal exercises, fellatio, anal sex, and anilingus .  The manual is no longer in print and hard to find, however “The Picayune”, a local Mississippi newspaper, managed to find a copy and trace the trail of it’s proceeds to the original  author via the publisher.

In the 1980s, he was heavily involved in gambling and stock market investments, which were covered by the Times-Picayune, as well as by others. Columbia Journalism Review, THE PICAYUNE CATCHES UP WITH DAVID DUKE Attitudes of Mississippi college students toward David Duke before and after seeing the film 'Who Is David Duke?' The Nation, Republicanizing the Race Card

In the latter years of the 1980s, Duke sought to revamp his appearance by undergoing plastic surgery, and also shaved off his moustache following his election to the Louisiana House of Representatives.

In 1984 David Duke and wife Chloe Hardin were divorced. Hardin then moved to West Palm Beach, Florida to be closer to her family. There she became involved with Duke’s childhood friend, Don Black, whom she married several years later. [http://www",0,0,0,0,0,0

 User:Mrs Gastrich 

I think it's a little suspicious that this user claims to be 's wife, thus seemingly alleviating concerns of sockpuppetry by probably using the same IP address. A problem is that  posted an RfA after merely 4 edits, which is disconcerting. 

However, your post on the page that Mrs Gastrich was a sockpuppet of God and to refer to the Bible I found inappropriate. I have since removed the offensive parts, leaving only the statement of possible sockpuppetry. I understand you may have passionate feelings about Gastrich and his involvement, but please do not deliberately publish untruths.

 TruSilver, Mediation, et al 

You can include the following statement as part of the mediation template if you wish: I'm not able to edit at the moment because jdchamp's admin shopping on WP:AIV finally paid off

While, obviously, I'm happy to accept any attempt to produce a better US Mobile Phone Companies template, I have concerns about the mediation proposal currently made on the subject.

My first concern is that mediation is supposed to be one of the tools used after discussion has failed on the relevant article's discussion page. At this stage, the only person who appears steadfastly unable to posit views other than attacks on editors and the fact he disagrees with them (a discussion requires that you express your reasons why, and address the reasons given by the people who have opposing views) is jdchamp. A better position at this point would be to ask jdchamp to participate fully in the discussion on the Talk: page of the appropriate article. I have contributed my views to that discussion page multiple times in the last two weeks, and given my reasons for my beliefs. I have done also said that I believe this is the most appropriate action at this stage to jdchamp, and to TruSilver, the admin jdchamp has involved in the dispute about what is going on there. Unfortunately, he has instead repeatedly posted the same comments over and over again to my talk: page, varying from false accusations of bad conduct from me, to expressing a willingness to discuss the article (yet, for some reason, not followed by actual action on his part.)

Mediation only makes sense if the parties involved continue to have a dispute that's based upon a genuine difference of opinion after proper discussion. While that different of opinion might exist at this point, unless jdchamp actually expresses his differing opinion fully (as in, gives valid reasons and challenges the reasons his opponents give with legitimate arguments), there has been no discussion, and therefore going on to the next stage of dispute resolution seems premature.

My second concern, and believe me I'm not happy in saying this, is that I have concerns about TruSilver as the mediator. Please do not take anything I say about this as assuming bad faith, I'm absolutely sure TruSilver thinks what he's done is right: but that said, I don't trust his judgment on this issue, based upon an on-going harassment campaign leveled against me by jdchamp. TruSilver has consistently misrepresented my actions while doing little to challenge jdchamp's on-going campaign. In particular:

 TruSilver has accused me of using his talk: page to continue my apparent argument with jdchamp. This is untrue: I have only ever posted once to TruSilver's talk: page, posting an apology for the fact he'd been involved in the mess and expressing my concern about it. After it became obvious that jdchamp was posting at the same time, and challenging my comments about my personal state of mind, I made the decision to not post there again.

 TruSilver has accused me of refusing to discuss jdchamp's differences with me, these differences concerning the Mobile Phone Companies template. This is also manifestly untrue. I have have been a full participant in the discussion on that page's Talk: page, even participating in a poll that I believe was posted prematurely, arguing why I believe what I do and suggesting compromise solutions that might suit all parties. I have removed jdchamp's vandalism of my page, which in some cases involved posting claims that he was """"willing to discuss"""" various issues, but were neither posted in the correct place, nor actual discussions of those issues.

 TruSilver has also leveled unnecessary personal attacks on me, accusing me of being dysfunctional, and of disruptiveness, edit warring, and incivility. With the possible exception of my (pretty justified) expression of frustration last night, nothing I've done of late fits the latter category, and the nearest thing I've done that comes to """"edit warring"""" consists of removing spam that has been repeatedly added to my page by jdchamp. The other comments are just plain insulting and wrong.

I've suffered a sustained campaign of harassment against me for most of the last 15 days. I asked for help, and instead the admin who put his hand up has essentially acted as an enabler for the person harassing me. Other than an ultimately unenforced threat to block jdchamp if he continued to spam WP:AIV with inappropriate demands I be blocked, nothing has been done to encourage jdchamp to tone down his behavior, and as he showed last night with three warnings, and multiple reverts on my Talk: page, his behavior remains as bad as ever.

While I'm sure TruSilver has acted in what he believes is the most appropriate way given the facts immediately available to him, I don't believe he h",0,0,0,0,0,0

Also, there is one vowel (a) which is inherent and is not written unless it begins a word. Also all consonant clusters are written as ligatures, which an alphabet does not do.

Now that the dust has cleared a bit, I thought it fitting to give you some feedback on the events of a couple of days ago. Do you know what a kyosaku is? In the zendo, when you """"lose your mind"""", you can request to be struck on the shoulder with a bamboo stick, to recover your alertness. Even if unrequested, I consider the block you imposed on me as a kyosaku, a welcome reminder not to let emotions get the better of me. After all, Wikipedia practice is very much like zen practice: You have to drop your ego to write well, and if done well the writing itself cuts ego further.

Paradoxically, however, that good effect came out of an action that was not so good. It came from an abuse of power, by you against me. When I am dealing with another user who laces his edits with vulgarities and ad hominem attacks, what I expect from the administrators is not one-sided, vindictive reactions, even if for a moment I lose my temper, but even-handed action that restores order and helps everyone maintain the focus on the writing.

To determine the best way to test for a feature, refer to the documentation for the feature of interest. The following list discusses some common techniques for feature detection:
You can test for the presence of the functions associated with a feature. To test for the presence of a function in a system DLL, call the LoadLibrary function to load the DLL. Then call the GetProcAddress function to determine whether the function of interest is present in the DLL. Use the pointer returned by GetProcAddress to call the function. Note that even if the function is present, it may be a stub that just returns an error code such as ERROR_CALL_NOT_IMPLEMENTED.
You can determine the presence of some features by using the GetSystemMetrics function. For example, you can detect multiple display monitors by calling GetSystemMetrics(SM_CMONITORS).
There are several versions of the redistributable DLLs that implement shell and common control features. For information about determining which versions are present on the system your application is running on, see the topic Shell and Common Controls Versions.
If you must require a particular operating system, be sure to use it as a minimum supported version, rather than design the test for the one operating system. This way, your detection code will continue to work on future versions of Windows.",0,0,0,0,0,0

 CAT:CSD hint removal 

I completly disagree with this statement.  It is like saying that this is a job that the admins have to do. It is not.  Having the admins do the patroling reduces the time that they have for other admin activities.  Some editors are already complaining that the admins are not doing editing since they are only doing admin work.  Having all editors do the screening takes a large amount of work away from the admins and allows them to spend more time on admin activities like doing deletes.  Patroling takes more time then reviewing the nominations and deleting those that need deleting, or moving to prod or moving to AfD or cleaning up or just pulling the tag.  Statements that make it sound like admins have to do this are not helpful in my opinion.  We should be pushing to have users do as much as they can and that's doing the patroling.   
One other point that you may be missing.  I do ocassionally patrol new pages.  In almost every case, I do not do a delete but add a speedy tag since I believe that I should not make a decision on my own.  Yes, there will always be a few cases where the decision is obvious.  But I believe that having someone else confirm my opinion is the right way to go.   
Yea, I could be more bold.  I know that my deletes are not approved by everyone given the trashing of my user and discussion page, saved by the bots!.  Maybe at some point I will be bolder.  I also skip quite a few and have also been accused of being too quick to pull the trigger.  I have come to the conclusion that there is no perfect balance.  No matter what you do, you will piss off someone.  In any case, I still try to do some editing.  If I was scanning the new pages I would not have time to do much else.  Part of the burnout problem is there is too much to do.  I think that we could do more good on the new page patrol if we could get the users to post a warning to the editors page when they add the notice.

What's up with this edit to Template:RuneScape? Does the game really seem more burnt sienna than periwinkle to you? To me, it's more of a powder blue or maybe something in the myrtle/fern green region. Cordially,  (tell)  =)

I support these changes. The key thing here is the placement of the counter-narrative (or call it what you will). This is a defining element of the page and of the story. Let me explain why I think it should have its own section. This page is called """"Tiananmen Square self-immolation incident,"""" not ''Tiananmen Square self-immolation hoax"""", or """"Tiananmen Square staged self-immolation."""" That is correct, but at the same time it is the same name that would be used if they were confirmed Falun Gong members. Since the nature of the incident is so crucial to defining the story, and that by default the 'argument' of the piece—that is, the entire way in which the story is known to the world—is through the claim that the individuals were Falun Gong practitioners. There would be no such thing as the """"""""Tiananmen Square self-immolation incident"""" if it were not claimed that they were Falun Gong members.  In this situation, making clear that there is a well-founded counter narrative is important. It's not something to stuff away to a side-box or the corner of the article. It should not dominate the page, but it should be as prominent as the other narrative (or more so depending on the evidence and wp:due)—therefore I think placing all of that information in its own section is quite appropriate. The other speculations and disputations about the identity of the people and so forth (the parts that are not strictly evidence-based) are separate to this arc. This is my opinion, I apologise for the laborious way I communicated it. I think it is a joke to dispute Pan's investigation. That's the most solid piece of evidence available in the whole thing. Most of the rest is just image-making, speculation, video cuts, and propaganda and counter-propaganda. —Zujine|talk """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Sorry if this seems stupid, but I don't know why this article exists. Do we also need to prove that 4 is bigger than 3? That 50 is bigger than 1.2? No.
 
The facts are:
 22/7, rounded to the nearest ten-thousandth, is 3.1429.
 It is trivial to demonstrate that fact.
 π, rounded to the nearest ten-thousandth, is 3.1416.
 That 3.1429 > 3.1416 is a triviality, not worth an article.
 BUT: The fact that π is approximately 3.1416 can be seen only be first doing quite a lot of work, some of it relying on methods that are relatively sophisticated by comparison to the bare statement that π is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to the diameter, or the like.
 By contrast, the proof given in the article shows that 22/7 > π in a way that is quick and simple, unlike all the work needed to see that π is approximately 3.1416, so you can see that 22/7 > π while skipping all the labor involved in seeing that π is about 3.1416.
 ...and the method by which it is done, in addition to being so short and simple, is elegant, immediately startling, and potentially enlightening in that you immediately wonder if it fits into some larger pattern that would give you insights not otherwise available.

 Proposed Edits to New 'Section 3.1' - Timeline, 1875-1925 

1885–1924: The origin of IBM
 Year  Gross Income (in $m)  Employees 1890   1895   1900   1905   1910   1915  4  1,672 1920  14  2,731 1925  13  3,698
 
The roots of IBM date back the the 1880s, decades before the development of electronic computers. The company was formed through a merger of three different companies: the Tabulating Machine Company (with origins in Washington, D.C. in the 1880s), the International Time Recording Company (founded 1900 in Endicott), and the Computing Scale Corporation (founded 1901 in Dayton, Ohio, USA)..  The merger was engineered by noted financier Charles Flint, and the new company was called the Computing Tabulating Recording (CTR) CorporationMartin Campbell-Kelly and William Aspray, Computer a History of the Information Machine — Second Edition, Westview Press, pages 37–39 2004. CTR was incorporated on June 16 1911 in Endicott, New York, U.S.A.. Flint remained a member of the board of CTR until his retirement in 1930.

The companies that merged to form CTR manufactured a wide range of products, including employee time-keeping systems, weighing scales, automatic meat slicers, coffee grinders, and most importantly for the development of the computer, punched card equipment. The product lines were very different, but Flint believed that since they all focused on equipment that made businesses more efficient, there were synergies and cross selling opportunities to be had.  Based in New York City, the new company had 1,300 employees and offices and plants in Endicott and Binghamton, New York; Dayton, Ohio; Detroit, Michigan; Washington, D.C.; and Toronto, Ontario.

Of the companies merged to form CTR, the most technologically significant was the Tabulating Machine Company, founded by Herman Hollerith, and specialized in the development of punched card data processing equipment. Hollerith's series of patents on tabulating machine technology, first applied for in 1884, drew on his work at the U.S. Census Bureau from 1879–82. Hollerith was initially trying to reduce the time and complexity needed to tabulate the 1890 Census. His development of punch cards in 1886 set the industry standard for the next 80 years of tabulating and computing data input. officemuseum.com – early Hollerith history, with good photographs of period equipment

The Tabulating Machine Company originally sold some machines to a railway company but quickly focused on the challenges of the largest statistical endeavor of its day - the 1900 US Census. After winning the government contract, and completing the project with amazing speed, Hollerith was faced with the challenge of sustaining the company in non-Census years He returned to targeting private businesses both in the United States and abroad, attempting to identify industry applications for his automatic punching, tabulating and sorting machines. But creating markets for the new technology was a struggle, and by 1911 Hollerith, now 51 and in failing health, was looking to rest on his laurels. He sold the business to  Flint for $2.3 million (of which Hollerith got $1.2 million), who then created C-T-R. Hollerith remained involved with C-T-R for some years as a consultant, but his involvement waned as time went on.

When the diversified businesses of C-T-R proved difficult to manage, Flint turned for help to the former No. 2 executive at the National Cash Register Company, Thomas J. Watson Sr.. Watson became General Manager of C-T-R in 1914 and President in 1915. I Drawing upon his managerial experience at NCR, Watson quickly implemented a series of effective business tactics: generous sales incentives, a focus on customer service, an insistence on well-groomed, dark-suited salesmen, and an evangelical fervor for instilling company pride and loyalty in every worker. As the sales force grew into a highly professional and knowledgeable arm of the company, Watson focused their",0,0,0,0,0,0

Wrong again.  So far you have only based your claim on a web site.  Iranica does NOT say that Aryanem Vaejo is in Afghanistan, nor does Iranica say that any part of Afghanistan has ever been called Ariana.  If it does, paste the EXACT quote here WITH A LINK to that article.  The association of Afghanistan and """"Ariana"""" for the FIRST TIME IN HISTORY appeared after World War II and this includes the name for their airlines """"Ariana Airlines"""".  You seem to be of the mindset that no matter what, nobody should change what you put in the articles. This is indicative of poor upbringing by your parents. Your parents have produced a foolish Mr. Know It All who is not smart enough to distinguish between the real world and the our-son-is-never-wrong environment of his mommy's house.  This is stupid.  I have offered plenty of serious and verifiable examples that shows what you are forcefully injecting in this article is wrong,  but it seems that you are only interested in a stupid and stubborn childish game of just winning an argument at any cost, no matter what the truth is. Tell me which of the following points is wrong:
1- No reputable scholar has ever claimed that Aryanem Vajo is in Afghanistan.  

2- One scholar, the late Professor Bahram Farahvashi, who dedicated his life to Iranian studies and has several respectable publications, including his award winning Dictionary of Pahlavi Language, has a book by the title of """"Iran Vij"""" which is precisely about Aryanem Vaejo which Zereshk claims to be Afghanistan. According to this book, as well as other scholars, Aryanem Vaejo is next to the Caspian Sea.  Farahvashi also mentions the names of the scholars who think (and gives their reasons as to why they think) that Aryanem Vaejo is next to the Aral Sea.  In no case anybody has suggested it is in Afghanistan.

3- In at least three of the Achaemenids inscriptions (by Darius I and his son Xerxes) where they mention the word Arya  (that is, the Old Persian word Arya) in the SAME INSCRIPTION they also mention Haraiva (modern day Herat which was recorded as """"Aria"""" in Greek texts) as one of the provices under their rule.  The two words are DISTINCLY DIFFERENT words with different spellings.  Only due to the Greek rendering of Haraiva as Aria this confusion exists today (and even then, it surfaces after World War II, because someone found a way to associate Afghanistan with """"Aryan"""" and others picked it up.)

4- Unlike what Zereshk claims, Encyclopedia Iranica DOES NOT say that Afghanistan is the same as Aryanem Vaejo nor does it anywhere say that Afghanistan has EVER been called """"Ariana"""".

5- Show me one authentic source from BEFORE WORLD WAR II, that shows any part of Afghanistan has ever been called """"Ariana"""" or """"Aryana"""".  Just one source would be enough, but it has to be an authentic and academically acceptable source, such a book from antiquity or the like, and NOT afghani web sites from the 21st century.  By repeating that the """"official afghanis website says so"""" you only show how weak your argument is.

5- Last but not least, in your revert message you offered the reason [this is] """"the OFFICIAL POSITION of The Islamic Republic of Afghanistan""""  well, that is not good enough.  Wikipedia is an encyclopedia not the official website of Afghanistan.  What """"the OFFICIAL POSITION of The Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"""" is irrelevant here.

 Collapsing 

Hey Peter - regarding this, the reason I collapsed that section of the discussion was because it was almost entirely about Tetra's edits use of AWB, not answering the original question of capitalization standards. Since the DRN discussion ended with TQ losing access to AWB, and the goal now is to get that clear consensus, I collapsed that area to tidy up and focus on the discussion regarding capitalization, and the consideration of extending the discussion to MOS (particularly if anyone new wants to chime in). If you don't think it was appropriate, I won't challenge that - maybe it'd be worth separating what I collapsed into it's own sub-header? I'll leave that for you to consider.

I asked you to prove you can't appeal an ITN decision, not whether you had ever seen it done or not. The appeal venue is obviously the talk page, or I suppose the talk page of the person who made the decision. I went to the talk page, and nobody said I couldn't appeal, they just rejected it out of hand. If I contravened the no appeal rule, they're certainly being very coy about it. And quite obviously it doesn't take 7 days to figure out if a decision was wrong - and in case you hadn't noticed, 4 days later and Gerry Adams is still under arrest, and it's still in the news, so even in this case, I'm sure if Wikipedia wasn't such a dysfunctional place, the veracity of the original decision could have been examined exhaustively by now. But no, you all seem to prefer to handle it quite differently - prefering to talk endless rubbish about sticks and horses and telling people they don't understand things, things that you're all not even prepared to answer a few simple questions about.

Although Lang Lang does (visually) look like an idiot when he performs with his weird facial expressions and over exaggerated face... he still happens to be a brilliant pianist (in the pieces where he doesn't decide to go 10 times the speed as directed.) 

Richard Kastle however as far as I (or many other people have tried) know has never had a single CD published or recorded. The fact that on the entirety of YouTube there is about 30 seconds of actual footage of Richard Kastle playing and a still shot of him on a Jay Leno show. 

Many of the so called 'trolls' that abuse Richard Kastle have a right to do so, due to the fact that a couple of psychologically disturbed people who praise him for being the greatest pianist of all time are truly wrong. There is also video footage on YouTube of a guy (who I believe is Kastle) discrediting major pianists such as Horowitz and Cziffra because they 'supposedly' simplified parts of their repertoire. This is completely NOT true due to the fact that University Professionals and other Professional Pianists would easily have picked up such a disregard for the music, in seconds. 

This article on Richard Kastle should be deleted due to the fact that it is just another excuse for one of those psychologically disturbed people who praise him for being the greatest pianist of all time, to brag about a man who does not deserve the credit he deserves. If it IS true that Kastle did actually discredit the great pianists - this page should be taken down for praising a slander who has the audacity to verbally abuse the good name and brilliant talent of the pianists who are deceased and have no way of discrediting this so called fraud called 'Richard Kastle'.

 About SMEs, 0RR and reverts 

Yes, while I agree that we're probably a long way from being able to implement SMEs at Wikipedia (it's something to shoot for, though), my immediate concern, as several examples were given in the RfC, are that a a blanket implementation of 0RR (for example) may at times get in the way of getting a properly balanced, neutral content (as I'm sure you know that NPOV isn't to treat all viewpoints as if they had the same validity, but to treat them commensurately with their weight """"in the real world""""  which is far trickier). What I was suggesting was to have a community-wide discussion on the current special editing restrictions that seem to be cropping up, namely to see how they may clash with Wikipedia's core policies, and ways in which we can avoid having this clash and still implement them when necessary. I firmly believe that most of the trouble Elonka got herself into probably comes from the even application of these rules, whose impact on core policies was probably not properly gauged prior to their application. What I'm suggesting is for the community to go back to the drawing board, discuss these rules, see how they can best be applied (are there necessary exceptions, for example?) derive a consensus and implement it. This would avoid this unpleasant feeling of being experimented upon that some editors have, and would go a long way towards reinstating the feeling that the community has the final say on its destinies (by shaping the new rules applying to it).

Too optimiitic? Idealist? Maybe yes. But worth a shot, I'm convinced of that.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Fanboy is a term used to describe an individual (usually male; the feminine version fangirl may be used for females) who is utterly devoted to a single fannish subject, or to a single point of view within that subject, often to the point where it is considered an obsession. Fanboys remain loyal to their particular obsession, disregarding any factors (often including logic) that differ from their point of view. 

 Background 
Stereotypical fanboys are attributed with a sycophantic devotion to the creators and principles behind a work with which they are currently enthralled. Fanboys are noted for a very emotional attachment to their chosen subject, often taking negative remarks about it as a personal attack. They will readily engage in debates, but will fall back on emotional responses when challenged on facts. For example, a fanboy may go out of his way to point out negative and often untrue statements about their obsession's rivals. Fanboys are often hostile towards critical review of their chosen subject. The stereotypical image of the fanboy is as an unkempt, socially awkward young man who may be perceived as a loud mouthed pseudo-intellectual. Fanboys  are also typically aggressive and hateful towards the opposing brand or competition of their obsession regardless of its merits or achievements. 

As electronic entertainment gained popularity, the term became increasingly applied to video game and television addicts. As a result, a subculture emerged which readily labeled itself as """"fanboys."""" Within this group, more effort is taken to fit in with a perceived standard, resulting in a more outgoing attitude, even among those with insecurities. This outgoing stance is often felt to be abrasive by those not involved in the culture as deeply. The term originated in comic book circles, to describe someone who immersed himself in the fictional worlds of comics and the culture of comics fandom.  The term is often used in a derogatory manner by other less obsessed fans. The term is most commonly associated with adolescent and teen males but can be applicable to any age or sex.

The term fangirl, while similar, often carries slightly different connotations. The term fangirl is often applied to any enthusiastic female fan, regardless of obsessive qualities or not, and is often used with overtones of """"teenybopper"""".

History of fanboys and the term
The term """"fanboy"""" is most commonly associated with adolescent and teen males but can be applicable to any age or sex. It is often used in a derogatory manner by other, less obsessed fans. The term originated in comic book circles to describe someone immersed in the fictional worlds of comics and the culture of comics fandom. Common subjects of reverence by fanboys are specific: TV shows; movies; music; anime; comic books; cars; video game consoles, video games and MMORPGs; and computer operating systems, hardware and software.
 
Popular depictions of Fanboy stereotypes include the Comic Book Guy on The Simpsons and columnist Larry Groznic from the satirical newspaper The Onion.  In the songs of the fannish parody musician Luke Ski, many characters proudly consider themselves fanboys.

The earliest published uses of the word """"fanboy"""" have been dated to 1982.  One reference is to the cover of the """"Official Underground and Newave Comix Price Guide"""".  On this cover page are sketched overweight, overzealous comic book collectors wearing T-shirts that state """"Fanboys of America,"""" who are describing the extreme measures they would go to, including moving to San Francisco, to preserve their comics.

Also published in 1982, a comic strip appeared in Jim Engel and Chuck Fiala's """"Fandom Confidential"""" comic.  In the strip, Jim and Chuck met comic artist/writer John Byrne and collapsed into """"mindless paroxysms of adoration.""""  The John Byrne character responded that they were """"a couple of fanboys in bondage"""" (a play on words referring to a Monty Python sketch in which an Elizabethan era character reads what she claims to be a new Shakespeare work called """"Gay Boys in Bondage"""". http://www.byrnerobotics.com/FAQ/listing.asp?ID=7&T1;=Miscellaneous+Questions#154 Another early use is in a smart-alec editorial reply by """"Ambush Bug"""" to a letter in his comic in 1985.

Hi Myrdred,

The best way to move articles is to use the Move link on the left-hand side of the page.  Cutting and pasting the text of articles from one to another only moves the text; it does not move the edit history.  Fragmenting the edit history is both a nuisance and a legal issue, because when we don't provide a list of all contributors to an article, we are violating the GNU Free Documentation License.  For this reason, you should always use the built-in move feature.  If the location you wish to move to already exists, you will have to convince an administrator to do the move.

 """"Mecca""""? 

""""JMU's reputation as a party school also further strains its relation with the community, as student housing surrounding the university has long been a mecca for underaged drinking. Many in the community stereotype the students because of this reputation, leading to further strain between each group""""

I won't disagree- there are Harrisonburg residents who are concerned about the relationship between the city and the university, but I can't help but think the above statement is overkill. The first clause, """"JMU's reputation as a party school also further strains its relation with the community"""", seems suitable enough to make the point (despite being grammatically unstable). The second bit, """"It has long been a mecca for underage drinking"""" is inappropriate, however. 

Mecca is a city in Saudi Arabia, regarded as the holiest meeting site in Islam, and it is not an accurate literal description of social life around JMU. The use of the word """"Mecca"""" in this context could be offensive regardless of any religious affiliation.

Again, I acknowledge that there is tension between the community and JMU due in part to excessive partying, but still- that entire paragraph is based largely on opinion. I would appreciate knowing specifically what these community stereotypes are, and how they are known.

Hi, thanks for the email. I assume it's the article above to which you refer. I deleted your article because it did not provide independent verifiable sources to enable us to verify the facts or show that it meets the notability guidelines. It is also now wikipedia policy that biographical articles about living people must have independent verifiable references. As a matter of policy, all biographies of living people will be deleted if they do not have references. Although you gave references, one was to a commercial sales site, which is spammy, one was your own site, and the other was an anonymous review by an unknown editor.

Articles must be neutral and encyclopaedic. This seemed to be intended to promote your autobiography. You have an obvious conflict of interest when it comes to editing articles about this subject. Thank you for declaring your interest - your honesty in this matter is appreciated. If, after reading the information about notability linked above, you still believe that you are notable enough for a Wikipedia article (and that there is significant coverage of the centre in reliable, independent secondary sources), you could post a request at Wikipedia:Requested articles for the article to be created. See also Wikipedia:Best practices for editors with conflicts of interest.

I deleted the article about the book too. The article was substantially a copyright violation, taken from Amazon (© 1996-2012, Amazon.com, Inc. or its affiliates). Copyrighted text is not allowed in Wikipedia, as outlined in this policy. It again did not provide independent verifiable sources to enable us to verify the facts or show that it meets the notability guidelines for books, and the links were to sales or other dubious sites.

The """"N"""" was for networking. I provided hooks in the PET ROM so that the """"Teacher's PET"""" be attached to a master-slave network. In the Commodore 64 there was a cartridge with the networking software and an interface card to the 6522 serial port.  We had two test installations in New Brighton Middle School in Capitola, Ca. and the Watsonville Middle School in Watsonville, Ca. Both had a PET with 30 C-64's. I developed all the hardware and did the fabrication myself.  Later a school in Wayne, PA was set up with a similar installation.

Another misconception is the origin of the Vic-20.  The real creator of the concept was Jim Kennedy who was the Commodore engineering manager after Chuck Peddle left in August, 1978 to work at Apple. Jack Tramiel asked him to visit MOS and he talked to Bob Yannes where he got the specs for the VIC chip.  He and I discussed a prototype VIC-20  but unfortunately Kennedy was canned in February 1980 when CHuck was re-hired by Commodore.

9040fd3ef37948db,"This article confuses several different types of anti-personnel ammunition - originally called 'shrapnel' (after its inventor), 'grape' and 'cannister'.  Shrapnel and cannister seem to have been mainly land service ammunition while 'grape' seems to have been mainly naval.

Shrapnel was invented circa 1800, but later that century it was used with more modern shaped shells.  A shrapnel shell is like a flying shotgun, the bullets are ejected while the shell is in flight by a small charge and they fly forwards in a cone.  The charge is initiated by a time fuze (igniferious at this period)in the shell's nose, which is blown clear as the bullets leave.  Bullet sizes varied, but by WW1 they were usually lead antimony alloy with a few hundred bullets per pound weight.

Cannister, in contrast, is bullets in a can and the can bursts as it is fired.  This means cannister is short range.  While shrapnel was little used in WW2, cannister was developed for various weapons including tanks.  Australian Centurion tanks in Vietnam had 20-pdr cannister.

Cannister was always carried by British artillery in its 19th century campaigns and quite widely used. Sometimes it had to be locally assembled from old bully-beef cans. Shrapnel remained their primary anti personnel weapon into WW1, and always the ammunition of choice against 'troops in the open'. In 1945 they successfully trialled 95mm shrapnel fuzed VT.

Beehive, correctly called Splintex, was developed by the US in the Vietnam period.  It is a shrapnel type shell - it is fitted with a mechanical time fuze and the flechettes are fired forward from the shell in flight. It was available for 105mm arty, 106mm RCL, 90mm RCL, and probably others.  US policy was for splintex to be only fired at direct fire, ie for arty it was local defence only, presumably for fear of blinds being re-cycled by the enemy into IEDs.  However, the USSR appears to have subsequently developed 122mm and 152mm shells of this type and used them for indirect fire.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Hi,

I deleted your recent comment on my talk page because I considered it to be rude. The loss of a chance to debate the technical issues you raised was a shame. I think we are both trying to improve matters of style. Furthermore, we appear to agree on many of those matters.

I am copying your comments to wp:mosnum so that the substantive issues that you raised can be debated more widely. That seems to be me to be a good place. See you there.  

How ironic. I considered it rude of you to dismiss a constructive suggestion on the basis that doing things the right way was too difficult and slow for you. Like I said, you'd rather do a half-assed job because it's quicker and easier than doing it properly. In future, expect your edits to be rolled back summarily - your dismissive attitude deserves to be reciprocated.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

I did not say it was a single book, but what you linked to says it is a 'corpus,' and it is often published at once, though apparently there is debate whether it was all written by Zoroaster.  At least for what Zoroaster wrote, I think philosophy does play a part, mostly involving semantics (difficult; knowing esoteric philosophy helps to interpret spiritually/divinely inspired texts) as you described, but perhaps also with gematria, or as HPB wrote, perhaps with 5 other methods than these latter 2.  Since many esoteric mystics have consensus on philosophy, not the least of which is ethics, methods of interpretation are important.

Here's a helpful passage from Natalie J. Purcell's Death Metal Music: The Passion and Politics of a Subculture, published by the very respectable McFarland ():
Across the sea, in the UK, Napalm Death would release Scum in 1987. The two-sided album was extremely influential. Though side one featured very punk-influenced guitaring, the second side displayed the impressive Death Metal guitarwork of Bill Steer, which would spur the Grindcore movement. The tempos of the album were incredibly fast, with quadruple-time beats and extremely short songs. The album also featured deep grunted vocals advocating leftist politics. Napalm Death followed Scum with the equally extreme 1988 release From Enslavement to Obliteration. Soon, British Grindcore bands like Unseen Terror, Ripcord, Heresy, Concrete Sox, Carcass, The Electro-Hippies, and others began popping up....

 Sorry for the delay in getting back to you.
 For each report, there's a /Configuration subpage (e.g., Wikipedia:Database reports/Articles containing red-linked files/Configuration). This houses the code that the report uses (assuming the page is up-to-date). If you want reports in English, you shouldn't need to modify this code at all, you just need to run it.
 If you look at  you can see the source code for the database reports. There's also a file called settings.sample. Following the format in that file, you'll need to create your own settings.py file with the appropriate information. Your host is probably """"localhost"""".
 All reports use the wikitools framework and rely on cron to run regularly.

I don't suppose you'd like to do the honours? )   

I'll try to get something of value on these guys together this weekend. I remember having an attempt back when they were first registered with the AEC, but I had a lot of difficulty working out exactly what their relationship with the CDP was (they seem to be what used to be the Victorian branch of the CDP, with possibly several others, still affiliated with them somehow). Hopefully there's some more info around now, especially with this by-election in the works. (I had a look at the by-election page and fixed up the candidates table a little - it was listing candidates of the Democrats, Secular Party and SEP, none of which are registered in Victoria. I have noticed, though, that Antony has started listing unregistered parties in much the same way as registered ones, so this will be worth keeping an eye on in the future.)

Okay. I guess half the problemn is that you clearly haven't a strong grasp on the English grammar, and therefore do not understand often what people are writing.
'experts on the period who only use, like myself, RS' means I exclude myself from being 'a highly informed expert on al-Husseini' (unlike say Pluto and Zero, or even Greyshark).

See that section of my full article on this.  Overall, the formation of Azerbaijani-Turkish ethnic group is from the 13th-16th century.  But the USSR usage of Azerbaijani was not clear.  The ethnonym """"Azerbaijani"""" though is very recently and dates back to the early 20th or late 19th century.  In some sources, """"Azerbaijani"""" is used to refef to any modern inhabitant of the republic while """"Azeri"""" is the ethnic term meaning Azeri-Turk  

As noted by Oliver Roy:
“The concept of Azeri identity barely appears at all before 1920.  Up until that point Azerbaijan had been a purely geographical area.  Before 1924, the Russians called Azeri Tatars """"Turk"""" or """"Muslims"""".(Roy, Oliver. “The new Central Asia: The Creation of Nations”). 

According to Prof. Tadeusz Swietochovski: """"Azerbaijani"""" was coined in the 1930s to refer to the inhabitants of the Soviet republic of Azerbaijan.(Azerbaijan Seven Years of Conflict Nagorno-Karabagh – Human Rights Watch / Helsinki– December 1994 by Human Rights Watch).

So a historical article should not have anachronistic terms.

According to the multi-volume book “History of the East” (“Transcaucasia in XI-XV centuries” in Rostislav Borisovich Rybakov (editor), History of the East. 6 volumes.  v. 2. “East during the Middle Ages: Chapter V., 2002. – ISBN 5-02-017711-3.  http://gumilevica.kulichki.com/HE2/he2510.htm )

What did the USSR mean by Azerbaijani?

Since the ethnonym Azerbaijani for an ethnic group was new, the USSR era did not provide a clear definition.  For example some considered Azerbaijanis to be Medes, others as Turks and others as Caucasian Albanians.  Then there was theories combining some or all of these.  This is another reason why calling Nezami Ganjavi as “Azerbaijani” in the politicized USSR sources lacks clarity.  Do they mean Medes(and the descendant of Iranic Medes like Talysh, Kurds?), or Caucasian Albanians or Turks and etc.

For  example  Bolukbashi mentions(Susha Bolukbashi,  ‘Nation building in Azerbaijan: The Soviet Legacy and the Impact of the Karabakh Conflict’ in Van Schendel, Willem(Editor) . Identity Politics in Central Asia and the Muslim World: Nationalism, Ethnicity and Labour in the Twentieth Century. London , GBR: I. B. Tauris & Company, Limited, 2001.):

How can we presuppose that Michel Aoun enjoys the support of more than 70% of the population when the last election results of 2005 prove that statistic wrong and no comprehensive polling of the Christian population has ever been conducted? This is speculative at best (and perhaps too optimistic, again, according to 2005 election results). Also, Michel Aoun's knowledge of Italian and Spanish is paltry at best, so that should be put into question as well. In addition, no mention of Aoun's """"poor parents"""" has ever been made, unless you assume that having a butcher for a father is an unquestionable characteristic of poverty and low-class. Also, as reference to his tenure as prime minister from 1988 to 1990, I propose adding an """"acting"""" in parentheses after the prime minister title, as the Lebanese Constitution briefs that only a Sunni Muslim may hold that position (or we should precise that his tenure was an exception or an anomaly, once again for the reason listed earlier).""",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Clarification needed - Run in with Tom Pettigrew after shooting her brother 

According to the Wiki article, under """"Brother's shooting"""": """"...later pointing the weapon at a moving vehicle on the adjacent road, trying to get into the vehicle....""""

Does the above have anything to do with this?  It doesn't seem so to me.  Here's a snippet of the article:

Carrying a shotgun by her side, a 21-year-old Bishop walked intently across a car lot into the adjacent storefront, where she began searching for car keys. Coming down from the second floor, she was heading toward the garage when she ran into Tom Pettigrew and a friend, who had spotted her in the parking lot and came to investigate.  """"Her gun hit me in the chest,"""" Pettigrew, 45, recalled from his Quincy apartment. """"I yelled, 'What are you doing?' and she screamed at me to put my hands up. So I put my hands up.""""

But the Braintree police chief has cast doubt on that conclusion [that she accidentally killed her brother], and the armed confrontation at the garage provides new insight into her state of mind after her brother's death. The Boston Herald first reported Pettigrew's account of the events today.  Only minutes after that shooting, according to Pettigrew, Bishop frantically told workers at the garage she had been in an argument with her husband and needed a car to escape, nervously scanning the premises as she kept the gun pointed at their backs.

So, my question is did this Pettigrew incident happen before or after she pointed the weapon at a moving vehicle?  In other words, what's the time line?  Thanks.    """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Some Mexican editors seem to consider that 9 to 15 million people in Mexico are ethnically Spanish. To support this they offer:
 a Tour operator page about tourism in Mexico: roughly as unreliable as it gets. But even worse...
 a link to the Encyclopaedia Britannica which simply does not have anything even remotely similar to the 9 to 15 million claim.

However, all that is not the real problem. The real problem is this: what have all those millions to be counted as ethnically Spanish? Note that we alrady had a discussion in About Regions with significant populations, where there was an agreement to erase the figures of Spanish people based exclusively on presumed ancestry and white race.

 If the reason to include someone as part of the Spanish people is simply ancestry, the amount for Mexico and other Latinamerican countries would probably get near 100% of the population... rather preposterous.
 If the reason are cultural traits, then we should know which are those traits, how they are different between individuals and what statistics we have about them.

There is no difference in rhetoric. The quote that Jayjg took out of context was a citation from the Qur'an that Hamas uses (also out of context) to justify the killing of Jews. Zionists use similar tactics (that's where Hamas learned it) by quoting the Torah and Talmud to justify the killing of non-Jews. """"We must treat the Arabs like the Amalekites"""" is a common sentiment among extremist Zionists. There are quotes from Zionist rabbis on this page that are indistinguishable from the logic of Hamas clerics. The denial of Zionism's genocidal intent and practice is similar to Nazis who denied the Holocaust and Final Solution even as they conducted it. Zionists claim to be ethical and humanitarian while routinely killing hundreds of children, imprisoning thousands of adults and oppressing millions of non-Jews in the name of their Jewish supremacist ideology and state.  02:55, 12 Dec 2004 (UTC)""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Then take it out if you want.  This is a very popular article that is attracting many vandals, several of whom have changed other stuff I put in it.  I told you three times that I watched this television segment.  I did not read a summary of it in a book or magazine.  I saw and heard it.  I remember what Janis' parents were wearing and what their eyeglass frames were like.  I did not tell the reader to go to the library in Baltimore.  I said there is a 16 millimeter film copy of it there, which doesn't mean it's the only library that has it.  It could be in a lot of libraries.  

Since you evidently never have been to the Baltimore library, then don't assume it has a """"card/computer entry.""""  I checked out the reel of 16 millimeter film in 1984 after finding the title """"Janis Joplin"""" in the film catalog.  I told the film clerk (it wasn't a librarian) that I wanted to check out that title, and he returned with it a few minutes later.  All he needed was the title.  I supplied the 16 millimeter projector, which I no longer own.  (Do YOU know anyone who owns one ?)  Several years later (1992), I heard a radio interview with Janis' sister Laura, promoting her book Love, Janis, in which a phone caller asked her if she recalled that 60 Minutes segment from shortly after Janis' death.  Laura corrected him, saying it came from a primitive NBC news magazine show titled """"First Tuesday.""""  I will try to split up those footnotes, but I can't guarantee it.

Big changes: There are NO links to other articles in this article. The interconnected nature of Wikipedia is its strength this needs to be changed! Your style of writing is too conversational for an informational article. Write as if you are the expert. 

Little changes: Using Wiki markup to force a table of contents at the beginning could add structure to this article. This might help you better relate a topic to the next topic you're going to discuss. I would also suggest moving the image up to the top of the article, so you can immediately communicate visually with the reader.

Style suggestions: It needs some spell check; read it out loud to catch them if your word processor didn't. It could also use some grammatical editing to avoid embarrassing apostrophes dropping in wherever they like. 

Visual suggestions: The figure is well-made (that is, it gets across the process of producing a river anticline) but it is not properly tagged according to wiki's copyright protocols and it could stand some labeling and uploading in a higher resolution.

Overall, you have a good start. Adding links to other articles and presenting the most professional article you can will help you get the rest of the way there. Cheers!",0,0,0,0,0,0

noun

1. music, Same as electronic music.

2. ELECTRO (music), Electro (also known as Electro-Funk) is an electronic style of hip hop directly influenced by Kraftwerk, Jazz-Funk and Funk records (unlike earlier rap records that were closer to disco). Records in the genre are unabashed about their use of electronic and artificial sounds, taking this technological fetish almost into science fiction with many records about space travel and futuristic dystopias. Timing range is 118 to 135 beats per minute(BPM). Electro is a derivitive of the '[Roland TR-808 Rhythm Composer, Roland TR-909 Rhythm Composer, Roland SVC-350 Vocoder, Roland VP-330 Vocoder Plus, Roland VP-330 Vocoder]' Drum machines & Vocoder's Speech Synthesizer. Electro's sound is distinctively synthetic, instrumental, electronic and experimental. Additionally, the 808 drum machines pounding beats and pure sounds were heavily used in Hip Hop, Disco and Funk music. It was very popular in New York City during the early 1980s and late 1970s.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Libelous Content Warning
Errors in reposting of old entry:

I reverted this entry back to the content I posted back in November (making certain modifications since Mills is no longer Insurance Superintendent) because of the following errors and libelous content:

1.  Old entry starts that Mills was from Middletown, but he was originally from the Town of Wallkill.

2.  The police department entry was not cited, and I happen to know that the content listed here happened after Mills had left the Town Supervisor post.

3.  Information about his decision to run for office again is not cited, and the quote """"many political observers believe his ethical lapses will be too great a hurdle to overcome in any future bid for elective office"""" is not cited and has no basis in fact.

I implore users not to make any other changes which are libelous and error ridden.  Thank you!

 Pornography

Without delving into the differing definitions of pornography, there's a specific example I can think of which illustrates my argument.  Let's say someone makes an amateur video of him or herself having intercourse, and let's postulate that this person decides to sell said video for whatever reason.  Since it's a depiction of a sex act and it's being distributed, this video would be considered pornographic by most definitions.  Nothing about it, however, is inherently hyperreal.  Someone might be interested in purchasing it for the purpose of sexual arousal, and I acknowledge that being aroused by a digital representation is clearly a """"hyperreal"""" act, but that doesn't make this piece of pornography hyperreal in and of itself.

The linear stance in most karate(aside from Goju, Kyukushin, and Kempo(Kenpo means law of the sword and is a mistranslation...of course language is weak and abstract...) is the initial stance to emphasize the kick as the primary attack in the attack, defense, or counter of an opponent; the beginning of most combos. Watch Lyoto Machida for example. Machida Karate is a return to the classical values and techniques of original Shotokan. He thrusts from the ball of the foot and when not attacking rests on the heel to conserve energy because it is a sport fight.

-Stephen went to Christ Church Grammer School until 1962 when his family moved to Melbourne. There he attended Brighton Grammer School from 1963 to 1969. In 1970 he attended Melbourne High School and received a Commonwealth Scholarship to attend Melbourne University to complete a Law Degree. Instead his father John Hastings Carew-Reid talked him into comming back to Perth WA and taking over the family stone business and completing a Bachelor of Commerce Degree during the years 1971-75. Stephen received 75% of the family company worth about $8,000 in compensation to his other two brothers and one sister receiving about $20,000 to start their adult life with. Stephen built this company up with wise real estate investments from $8,000 in value to over $500,000 by the end of the 1970's. Stephen wanted to develop these properties himself and make a further $1 million development profit by building town houses and offices on the land. During his university days he rented all the rooms out in the houses to pay for the mortgages, had two children and was one of the 8 selected out of over 2,000 entries to fly to Melbourne to be part of the Johny Young Song Festival. His father took control of the company back from Stephen by issuing an extra 5,000 shares now it was very valuable and stopped Stephen from developing the house himself and in fact sold the house to a property developer who made $1 million profit. His father died in 1986 and left the WA Public Trustee as executor of this will. Stephen ended up sueing the Public Trustee for mishandling the etate and ended up representing himself for over a decade in the WA Courts against the Public Trustee who used their power of City Hall against him. Stephen has ended up having his practical expereince in the courts before he did any formal training and has now written a series of books about the fight he has had with the WA Public Trustee and the WA Government called, The Triumph of Truth (Who S Watching the Watchers). The books have been named after his late Great Grand Father, Sir Edgar Bertram McKennal who was well known bronze sculpter in the earty 1900's in Melbourne who went on to becoming quite famous in Europe.

952459cd5df680f3,"Templates 

Hello. First, thanks for your contributions; you're doing some nice work. There are a couple of things I've noticed with your templates that could be improved, however. When you created a new version of Template:Cosmology at Template:Physical cosmology, and then set the old template to redirect to it, you hid the history of the template. Where possible, please put the replacement template at the same location as the old one, or move the old one to the new name, then put the new code in place. (If you're worried about making a mistake on the new template and messing up the articles it's used on, then use a sandbox.) If you do that, then not only do you keep the history of the page, but you make it easier for those of us that are watching the template to see the latest changes to it (i.e. those during and after the replacement). I've requested a history merge on Template:Physical cosmology to fix this (which means an admin will come along and merge the histories of the templates at some point).

Also, please make sure that you don't add extra whitespace (new lines) into the template, as that also appears on the articles if it's not in a noinclude tag. See  for an example of what I mean; your version had two extra lines at the bottom of the article, which were appearing in the articles the template was used on, whereas the problem is now fixed.

Finally, please categorize the templates you make. There's a whole load of template categories under Category:Wikipedia templates; the two you're most likely to be interested in are Category:Physics templates and Category:Astronomical templates (and their subcategories). Categorizing the templates makes it a lot easier for other people to find (and then use) them.

 Gabriel Olutola 

There are some issues with Gabriel Olutola, which I just deleted.

I had previously identified some concerns with this article. You seem to understand that there were issues and agreed to address them. We let some time elapse so you could address them, but you did not make any substantive progress toward resolving the problems.

In addition, you are not communicating in a way that is desirable for editors. You are perfectly free to remove material from your talk page (although archiving is generally considered preferable). However, if you simply remove material and do not respond, it is difficult to understand your thinking. I don't know for example, whether you felt that you cured the copyright problems, or perhaps thought that the source of the text was an acceptable source. If you explain your actions it will be easier to help you.

I recently deleted the article because it had copyright problems and I saw no action by you to address them. I now see that you have restored the article in substantially the same form as the article that was deleted. Again, if you do not communicate I do not know what you are thinking. I don't know whether you thought it was deleted in error, whether you thought you cured the problem, or something else.

I notice that the version you restored is not exactly worded the same way as the source. However, we have seen editors who think that changing a word here or there cures a copyright problem. It does not. Please read the following link for more information: Wikipedia:Close paraphrasing

I also ran a duplication detector which does not pick up close paraphrasing, it only picks up exact matches. Even with this cruder measure the article is problematic. I'll provide the link below so you can see the results. However, I emphasize that changing a word or two here or there to eliminate the exact matches is not the cure.

Duplication Detector

Unfortunately, we have identified other articles with issues. I haven't had a chance to look closely but we may be following up with other articles which need addressing.

I urge you to take this quite seriously. If you are editing with a misunderstanding of policy we can help you understand the rules. If you do understand the rules and ignore them, you may be blocked. Explaining your actions will be the best way to ensure that doesn't happen.(Talk) """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 My Conrtibutions to Shady Records 

So I've been asked to consult this page by JrPut or idk his name; but anyway:

The Shady Producers/DJ's list should be updated.
I have valid links for Mr. Porter, Alchemist, Rikanatti, and Luis Resto. The following are all Reliable links, and even though Aftermath Ent. Blog is a blog, we have used it as multible sources on additional articles, and we have also used MTV News as a reliable source, and that in itself is a blog.
 Alchemist 
Luis Resto
Rikanatti
Eminem also acts as a producer for the label, and since he is the founder, CEO, and signed to the label as its main artist, I would presume that linking references for him as a producer is frivalous and uneeded. 

Now, The Bass Brothers and Eminem have ended their working relationship. We have multible sources for this including when Em purchased his new studio, and F.B.T sued Interscope/Aftermath.

However, with that said, we have no additional proof that DJ Head has ended his working relationship with EM. We have no source saying that he has, and unless you supply one, we're going to be leaving him in the active section. Just because a producer didn't release any tracks for the label in a while does not constitute their absence from the label.

So Please, Let me re-add Alchemist, Eminem, Mr. Porter, Luis Resto, Rikanatti, and DJ Head to the production list, and let us move on with our lives. No need to keep pricking this crap in the butt.

 OneGuy's vanadalism of the discussion page 
Aside from OneGuy deleting other user's comments, he has now begun to blatently disorganize and effectively vanadalize people's comments: he distrupting the flow of users' comments by arbitrarily cutting off paragraphs and inserting his comments in between, instead of being civil and adding his reply to the end of a given post. Combined with his ceasless personal attacks, false accusations, and insistance on making wikipedia a propoganda machine for Islamist apologetics of the blackest kind, his behaviour has become completely intolerable, and I do not see any point in constantly refuting the same false accusations and false assertions over and over again. OneGuy must be ejected from this discussion before it can have any hope of being a civiled and productive debate. I am left with no choice but to completely resign from this discussion, since it seems that no one is going to be moderating OneGuy's behaviour anytime soon.  Pename

What's ironic is that OneGuy claims he is not a muslim and therefore can not be considered an Islamic apologist!  In fact, most of the Muhammad/Islam apologists here claim to not be Muslim!  Looks like Muhammad's best friends are the infidels.  

As of moderating OneGuy's behavior, the Arbitrators are looking into him and myself after he filed a hypocritical arbitration request against me and I thus filed a countercomplaint against OneGuy.  Whenever OneGuy spots someone who doesn't agree with his radical apologistic viewpoint he tries to silence them by any means at his disposal.  OneGuy, in his complaint in arbitration, accused me of rivert(sic) wars and having POV in my contributions yet he does the exact same thing, only more so.  In the arbitration complaint, the arbitrators don't seem as concerned about the POV contributions as they do about personal attacks, revert wars and my vandalism of his user page. See Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/168.209.97.34.  When OneGuy was giving evidence against me he incorrectly called a few minor word changes as a revert war (even though the change were only made once or twice) and he clearly left out the revert wars in which he was involved (but the arbitrators were not fooled - they found him out).

Since the arbitrators will probably not do anything about his radical apologistic contributions, they will most likely respond to his vandalism of the talk pages.  Feel free to post your complaints regarding OneGuy on Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/168.209.97.34/Evidence.    06:56, 9 Dec 2004 (UTC)

 Since when replying on talk page has become vandalism? Only one time I deleted Pename comments when he cut and pasted his comments that were already on the page on top of my response in a new section that I created (""""death to critics""""). Pename has ignored what we are discussing and is resorting to personal insults and false accusations (in violation of wiki policy) that I vandalized the talk page. He now claims that he did not copy the verse from anti-Islamic site. If true, where did he find the interpretation that 8:67 means kill prisoners of war? He implied that interpretation in the article. At worst, the verse condemns the behavior of taking prisoners in order to make money, but he has not given his source that says 8:67 means kill prisoners. Instead of answering where he found that interpretation (if not anti-Islamic site), Pename is resorting to personal insults and outright lies that I vandalized the talk page  18:46, 6 Dec 2004 (UTC)

 Some Wikipedia """"Contributors"""" giving the Dictator Jose Eduardo dos Santos an Engineer Degree in Petroleum 

Some Wikipedia """"Contributors"""" giving the Dictator Jose Eduardo dos Santos an Engineer Degree in Petroleum

This section is taken out from the propaganda web page of the MPLA Peoples Party (Communist Party). Looking at the dates there is no chance that Mr. Jose Eduardo dos Santos could have gone to Russia for a Oil Engineer Degree. Also the MPLA official web page does not mentions any such degree as well. Taking into consideration that this would be considered a major achievement it seems odd to say the least that the MPLA Comrades Totalitarian Party have """"forgotten"""" to mention this intellectual and academic achievement of their murderous and deep ignorant leader.

But in wikipedia from (night to day) """"voila"""" Mr. Jose Eduardo dos Santos (a son of a Sao Tome brick layer) could not have gone to Russia or Timbuktu for a degree, as it was economical impossible to him to afford such studies.

People in Angola who are still alive knew personally this communist and murderous pig, as having only two shirts and only a couple of suits, how could this criminal afford to go to Russia for his Engineer degree, and if he had been there and made his degree (3 to 4 years minimum) then there is no time in the description of his activities and exiled years in Congo Brazzaville.

From the MPLA Web Site: """"Após a eclosão da luta contra a ocupação colonial, em 4 de Fevereiro de 1961, José Eduardo dos Santos, então com 19 anos, abandonou em Novembro desse mesmo ano o país e passou a coordenar no exterior a actividade da Juventude do MPLA(organismo de que é um dos fundadores). Integrou em 1962 o EPLA (Exército Popular de Libertação de Angola), participando na preparação das condições para a abertura da 2ª Região Político-Militar. Em 1963 foi o primeiro representante do MPLA em Brazzaville/ Congo. Nesse mesmo país, depois de terminados os seus estudos superiores, frequentou durante um ano um curso Militar de Telecomunicações, que o habilitou a exercer, de 1970 a 1974, sucessivamente as funções de Operador do Centro Principal de Comunicações da Frente Norte e Responsável-adjunto dos Serviços de Telecomunicações na 2ª Região Político-Militar do MPLA (Cabinda). Em 1974, José Eduardo dos Santos é designado membro da Comissão Provisória de Reajustamento da Frente Norte, responsável das Finanças da 2ª Região, e desempenha novamente as funções de Representante do MPLA em Brazzaville, até Junho de 1975.""""

http://web.archive.org/web/20100828013436/http://www.mpla-angola.org/opresidente.php

So lets hope that common sense sinks in, and that we can see what is obvious, and lets not allow the good nature on which the Wikipedia project was founded and based to be a place where totalitarian communist regimes use this space and wikipedia inadvertently is perceived as a tool to validate their Regimes, we therefore as freemen and humans, we must not allow this space to be used with the aim to prize this (or other) criminal murderous Communist Dictator.

See also sections

Hi, """"see also"""" sections should not contain links to articles that are already linked to in the main body of an article (see WP:MOS). The whole section should therefore be removed from Democracy & Nature. Also, it's fine to list editorial board members, if there are independent sources that document what these people did for the journal. Most editorial board members don't ever do anything for a journal, so unless there are sources, we don't list them, no matter how notable they are. The same goes for contributors. If you want to tell readers that John Doe contributed to a journal, you will need an independent source that confirms that this was a notable contribution. It is not enough that John Doe himself is notable. Please see our journal article writing guide and WP:NOTINHERITED. In addition, WP does not allow original research and/or synthesis. So unless you have independent reliable sources, all those """"references"""" to the journal itself and claims that """"significant debates"""" were ignited will have to go. Thanks.

Hipocrite, I doubt that one isolated incident is evidence of a long history of a pattern of incivility.  If there are other examples in recent history, I'd be happy to evaluate them.  But no, it doesn't mean that if Pedro slips up 9 months from now, he's going to be insta-blocked for all eternity.  And, as for being on the recall list: Pedro asked me a long time ago if I'd have any objections to being on the list, and I said no.  That's about it.  As far as I am aware, being on the list means that I have the option of petitioning Pedro to relinquish his admin privileges, nothing more.  It doesn't mean I'm obligated to stalk all of his edits and make sure he's behaving.  At this point, I haven't seen any evidence that would convince me that he is no longer fit to be an admin.  Were the comments uncivil?  Of course they were.  Do they deserve a desysop or a block?  In my opinion, unless there is clear evidence that this was more than just an isolated incident of a personal attack, then no.  Everyone screws up from time to time.  We don't desysop/block people because they had a bad day, unless it can be shown that they've been having a bunch of bad days recently, and that it is disrupting people's ability to contribute to the encyclopedia.  Frankly (and I know you will probably all see this as the cabal protecting itself), I see this as a witch hunt against an admin that you don't particularly get along with.  If you have a real issue with Pedro and you have real evidence that this is a long-term problem, then please present evidence in the form of diffs and I will gladly evaluate it.  But, I'm not going to waste my time searching for it myself, because my hunch is that this is not going anywhere.  | spout _ """,0,0,0,0,0,0

I didn't add it someone else did. But yes he was placed on the cover in several countries.

 The British National Front was and is 'far-right', yes? Let's not whitewash in this article. 

In putting the term 'far right' before 'National Front', and removing the uncited last line that appears to promote Griffin (""""Since he became the leader of the BNP several educational institutions have invited him to speak on political radicalism, multiculturalism, and BNP policy."""") I have been reverted and accused of 'vandalism' by a regular editor here, User:Parrot of Doom. I would like to say that nobody WP:OWNS Wikipedia articles, and it is against Wikipedia policy to use the term 'vandalism' for an essentially 'POV' issue (POV means someone expressing a point of view) - especially one that is effectively factual - namely the NF being 'far-right'. Wikipedia describes the NF as """"a far right and whites-only party"""" in its main article - and this fact was as true when Griffin was a member of it as it is now. I also gave the clear reasons for removing the promotionally-phrased last line - so I'm not a vandal.

Having maintained that the National Front is indeed 'far right', can anyone really claim that adding this fact to this article is unhelpful or irrelevant? The current introducton gives very little real flavour of Nick Griffin (and his obvious 'notoriety' is left out completely), which compared to other Wikipedia articles on politicians is pretty scandalous in my eyes. Why be so accommodating to Griffin of all people? It looks like whitewashing is going on to me.

 BP 

First of all, I understand that you have a stake in this article.  You've put a lot of time and effort into it and you don't want to see it deleted.  I had an article deleted once, and I understand the frustration that you feel.  

If you read what constitutes a notable organization in WP:N and WP:ORG, it doesn't really meet the criteria set forth.  Yes, you've provided some sources that mention the Bulldog Party, but they aren't really considered, Significant coverage which means, """"that sources address the subject directly in detail..."""".  Also, WP:ORG states """"Organizations whose activities are local in scope are usually not notable unless verifiable information from reliable independent sources can be found,"""" however, it does say that, """"The organization’s longevity, size of membership, or major achievements, or other factors specific to the organization may be considered.""""  The Bulldog Party may have been around in some form since the 1950s, though, so maybe that might help  if you can prove it. 

The possible longevity and the """"major achievements"""" and """"other factors specific to the organization"""" is where you stand the best chance of defining why it's notable, because of this statement in the article, """"The Bulldog Party has inspired the formation of other student organizations on universities throughout Missouri, most notably the Bearcat Voice at Northwest Missouri State University and the Student Progressive Party at Lincoln University (Missouri).""""  However, this isn't sourced at all, and quite frankly, it's questionable whether the Bearcat Party article meet the notability criteria as well.

If I submitted this article to AFD, would it definitely get deleted?  Most definitely not.  There's a good chance that it would, but it's not a given.  However, no one could make the argument that it's good enough as it is and its notability shouldn't be questioned. 

Why has no one else brought this up before since you first created in March 2005?  Probably because it hasn't attracted a lot of attention and overall, it's well-written.  There aren't many other articles that link to it, so unless someone stumbles across it through those links, the only other way someone will find it is via Random Pages (unlikely with over 2 million other articles) or through Recent Changes (and since there have been barely over 50 edits in 3 years, that's not likely, either  especially if the edit wasn't vandalism).

Keep in mind that none of these arguments make an article notable or worth keeping:
 I like it... or It's interesting....
 It took me a long time to write....
 This other student political party has an article....
 It looks good... or It doesn't do any harm...

I'm not going to submit this article to AFD, but you really need to work on getting it fixed (if possible), because it's likely that someday someone else will come across it and come to the very same conclusion that I did about it.   Good luck, and happy editing.    """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Graeme, I just figured out how to answer you back directly on your user page. Thanks for your message. I would greatly appreciate you placing the proper license in my images for me. Also, I saw the copy of the license that someone put on Village Pump. I had difficulty locating it in the """"Commons"""". Also, please note that the dekolb paintings are not copyrighted at all (I said they were before). I have started to upload the paintings under a Attribution Share3.0 license. Is this correct?  I know I am going to have to fix the licensing for my downloads and do them again.  If you could help me I would appreciate it.

Also, I notice that underneath the picture """"storybook romance"""" that there is a reference #1 for eric dekolb-wartenberg, and it gives the date March 10, 1916. I looked at the subpage you created and couldn't find this date. Also, it says """"New York"""" underneath it. I would assume that deKolb was born in Vienna. Also, I will ask Mrs. deKolb more about the death of EricdeKolb. I really appreciate all of your help. Thank you so much. I would like to get this all done before the April 15th date.

Clearly, some have an emotional or economic interest in minimising or even denying the importance of these consumer-oriented blind tasting competitions: 

The Emperor Has No Clothes

The owners of 30 of  the best wines in the world, in the judgment of a Champagne company president, were invited to a party in 1997. The event was organized by Jean-Claude Rouzaud to celebrate the 30th anniversary of his presidency of Champagne Louis Roederer. Half of his selections were from France. """"I’m a chauvinist and a nationalist"""" he explained. 

""""Before agreeing to participate, the Bordeaux first growths set some conditions, the foremost being that no comparative tasting with their international competition would be held."""" They didn’t even want to be included in a group photo with their colleagues from other wine regions, although they finally reluctantly agreed.  """"But getting the Bordelais to have their wines served with the others', that was out of the question,"""" said a Roederer spokesperson.

So the event took place in two separate parts: first, a dinner featuring the Bordeaux wines; then a tasting the next day with all the other wines, but no Bordeaux. 

""""They are cowards,"""" said a non-Bordeaux producer.  But the host said  """"I understand them."""" He explained that  """"They feel that when you are first growths you are untouchable."""" Their problem is that they actually know better.

They and the other named growth vineyards have a carefully cultivated  image of  superiority. This is a marketing advantage worth an incredibly enormous sum of money every year. However, they frequently fail to perform well in blind comparisons and realize how vulnerable they are to exposure and the destruction of their vaulted  and very valuable reputations. 

Because of this the named growths  (1) want to avoid  comparisons  and (2) try to discredit  the results of such comparisons . Who can blame them? Those results can cost them a fortune in lost revenue. But the consumer benefits immensely.

The question of whether EM radiation can be treated as a classical EM wave or as a collection of photons is entirely dependent upon whether the number of photons collected in a measurment is large or small. If its large, then the classical treatment (i.e. spectral radiance over infinitesimal frequency bands ) will apply. Planck's law as stated in the article, calls  a spectral radiance, which immediately implies a classical EM wave, no reference needed.  Photonic emission is for any EM radiation where the number of photons collected is small, including Planck's law in certain cases. """"Broadband"""" means the radiation is spread out over a relatively wide bandwidth, """"narrowband"""" means it is not. Broadband is not necessarily photonic, nor is narrowband necessarily classical EM. Its not a matter of how spread out the radiation is, its a matter of how many photons are collected in a measurement. Broadband can be classical EM if many photons are collected, narrowband can be photonic if only a few are collected.

In order to facilitate reference to talk page discussions, I will need to create an archive page for the talk page content that one of the admins previously blanked.  Is there any problem with that?  

You can link to a permanent revision in the history if need be, so long as the page was not actually deleted.  

As far as I know, nothing was permanently deleted, although some discussions have been moved to archive pages.  The other thing I need to exhibit is the blocking message that KillerChihuahua posted.  That one does not appear in any revision of this talk page; it appears on a template that I see on my user page, but I don't think others see that template.  How do I reference or exhibit that original blocking message?  

Just go into the history, and click the appropriate date on a revision.  That will bring you to a page, with a link.  Here is an example, http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Moulton&oldid;=157221709.

As an aside, what will you do if unblocked?  Do you intend to edit articles again?  

How do I link to something that exhibits KillerChihuahua's original blocking message, wherein she gives the reason for blocking?  

It's too soon to decide what I will do if unblocked, as that depends on what transpires during the course of these proceedings.  If the objectives I set forth in my RfC are embraced and endorsed, then it's reasonable to imagine that it would be feasible for people like me to contribute to the crafting of mainspace articles.  If those objectives are repudiated by ArbCom, then there would be no point in editing articles, even if I were provisionally unblocked on technical grounds related to denial of due process. 

I have one other question on how these cases are titled.  Is there any standard convention on titling these cases?  

this is your block log.  Tilting?  

Not tilting, but titling.  Do I entitle the case """"Moulton"""" or """"Moulton v. KillerChihuaha"""" or """"KillerChihuahua"""" since she is the admin whose actions I am contesting.  

No vs.  You are verses anything.  You are requesting a unblock review to ArbCom.  """"Moulton"""" works.  

I have filled in the RfAr Template, and (unless you spot any deficiencies), I believe it is now ready for posting.  Would one of you (Nathan or Anthony) please do the honors? Thank you.

Thank you!   
Notice for any observing parties, I am moving to unblock Moulton, after current attempts to seek reassurance from Moulton that he will not edit any pages except his user space and the relevant RfArb. sections/pages are complete.  
P.S., Moulton: check your email.

a. He completely ignores the fact that there are views that specifically contest him being CEO (his attorney and the governement). b.

 Korean article template 

Hi, thanks for your question.  Sorry I'm so late getting back to you.  Life on and off Wikipedia has been full of all sorts of unexpected hecticity...  Anyway, the Korean article template. 

The idea behind the template is pretty simple.  The basic idea is that every article should have the following, unless there is some reason to the contrary:
 a relevant """"See also"""" section, 
 at least one relevant Korea-related category, and
 a name table.  
 Template:Korean on the Talk page.

In more detail...
The """"See also"""" section should include a link to the List of Korea-related topics  (LKRT), and anything else that's obviously relevant but not linked in the article text.  If you prefer, you can just put in the LKRT link and let someone else add the others.  If you want to add more, here's the rule I've been following:  look in each category of which the article is a member.  If that category has a main article (like Korea in Category:Korea), then that main article should be linked  either from the text, or from the See also section.  The same for parent categories, within reason.  Here's an example:  Munmu of Silla is a member of the categories Silla and Korean rulers.  Thus, the articles Silla and Rulers of Korea are linked in the article text.  Those two categories are part of Category:Korean history and Category:Korean people.  Thus, History of Korea is linked in the See also section, and so is List of Koreans (well, it is now).   Both of those are members of Category:Korea, hence the link to the LKRT.  
You can find a complete (?) list of Korea-related categories at List of Korea-related topics#Categories.  Or just start at Category:Korea and work your way down.
Template:Koreanname noimage is fine for the vast majority of articles.  Cut and paste Template talk:Koreanname noimage#Syntax and fill in the blanks.  All Korean name tables require you to specify at least these four variables: hangul, hanja, rr, and mr.  """"Rr"""" stands for Revised Romanization of Korean, and """"mr"""" stands for McCune-Reischauer Romanization.  If you don't know what should go in these fields, just leave them blank  however, at a minimum the hangul should be provided (that allows other editors to verify the article and identify the other name-related information).  You can request help on the Korea-related notice board.  
This one's easy.  Just paste {{Korean}} onto the top of the talk page.  Done!

Most of our existing articles should already conform to this, since we just finished a housekeeping sweep in June.  But there are more new ones coming in every day...

I've also taken to adding a """"Wish list"""" to the talk pages of new/inactive articles, identifying 2 or 3 things that the article is lacking.  Hopefully this will help other contributors see where they can help.   (Of course, if I can contribute the information myself, I do so).

I hope this isn't all too overwhelming.  Your excellent work so far is much appreciated.

Natasha- History is part of human civilization that has been neglected by the most. 
History is part of human civilization that has been neglected by the most. However, its significance is prodigious, and I believe it should be taught to all university students as a required subject because it expands knowledge, reflects the present issue, and impresses friends.

History tells us the stories from long time ago. Reading a history book is like traveling back in time to live in an alien era. It enables us to discover the origin of our lives to satisfy our curiosity and understand the cultural differences to help us live in harmony with peculiar customs. History untangles the mysteries in the past and assists us in the comprehension of both others and ourselves. 

History conveys important messages that assist us in dealing with present situations. By studying the past, we can efficiently overcome the obstacles at hand by emulating the previous success and by drawing lessons from the earlier failure. “D-day”, for instance, could not have been such a successful raid, if the allies had not formulated the winning strategy derived from the disastrous attack on Dieppe in 1940. In short, history reflects the present and teaches us how to face upcoming adversities.

Furthermore, knowing history is always a good way to show off around our friends. If we have accumulated rich knowledge of history, then when we go to a museum with our friends, we will guide them around and instruct them about the derivation of each item. They would definitely be surprised and exclaim in admiration. If learning history can bring astonishment in friends’ faces, then it is worthwhile. 

Time flies, and we, humble earthly creatures, only live in the present and yearn for the future. For the distant past, we are not privileged to see with our own eyes, but by learning history and utilizing all the historic records stored in libraries, we are able to find out what was happening, even in the distant past.",0,0,0,0,0,0

The lead does not directly call pescetarians vegetarians (due to dispute), but only presents that, in some authoritive dictionaries, vegetarianism may include the consumption of fish. As stated before, the lead then makes sure to tie that type of diet to pescetarianism, and note how pescetarianism being thought of as vegetarianism is disputed. Merriam-Webster even now defines pescetarianism  as """"vegetarians who eat fish"""" (as I've already mentioned)...so, clearly, there is validity in mentioning pescetarianism as being an aspect of vegetarianism (as much as veganism is), especially as long we note the dispute between the two terms, and especially when pescetarianism is present within the body of this article, below the lead.

""""  I am wondering if James W. Lowen,Italic textLies My Teacher Told MeItalic text, (New York, NY: Touchstone, 1995) could be used for this citation.  It is primarily critiquing American high school textbooks, not secondary sources, but is highly critical of their treatment of Brown.

Assyrian people are not all, or may not be, 100% ethnically Assyrian and may be descended of one or more of the following: the Assyrians and/or the people that they conquered, and/or of the people that conquered them. With the ancient people, there really would be no way to prove the lineage unless one was to unearth many ancient graves, examine and carbon date the remains, compare the DNA of the different graves, and then come up with a comparative analisys of the ancient peoples' DNA to that of the modern-day people. With the latter day arrivals of conquerors it is possible that they may have had some influence as well for at first a lot of the anscestors of the modern-day Arabs, Kurds, Mongols, Persians, and Turks were originally Christian and/or converts, and the area they ruled remained predominantly Christian with Syriac as the lingua franca up until the Islamic conquests. Many may have been assimilated into the Syriac Christian culture. The ancient Assyrian empire had a policy of deporting inhabitants from their natural environments and relocating them to urban areas of the empire in order to assimilate them into Assyro-Babylonian culture, which in turn caused a loss, or to the least of that extent, a merger of cultures, in turn somewhat destroying their own sense of national identity. That tactic was borrowed and applied by the Persians, and by many empires that followed, including the United States, with its former policy against Native Americans of relocating them to Reservations. Ironically, this has been the fate of the modern-day people. The Ba'ath parties of Iraq, Syria, and to a lesser extent, Syria's influence and interference in Lebanese affairs, were adament in replacing all ethnic identities with an Arab Nationalistic identity.

 Quoting emails 
Increasingly, some parties are quoting emails from the leaked archive (ex. . I thought that this was not to be done (""""No quoting of any email is to be done by persons other than the author or intended recipient(s)"""")? Am I mistaken? | talk  
I believe the intention of the provision you have quoted, is to prevent wide-scale quoting of entire emails and entire email exchanges; that is the assumption I will work off when taking affirmative action (as opposed to reactive action, such as this), although I invite you to have the Committee comment on my interpretation of it. Regardless, I'll ask Offliner to paraphrase what you wrote on the mailing list, although having him do this could be to your disadvantage as it provides him the opportunity to represent what you said on the mailing list in whatever way and with whatever language he chooses.   
Daniel, I don’t mind you removing my entire section (at your discretion) for as long as you read it, by going back to my post, and relating to the particulars listed in it. However, there’s nothing in the initial provisions of this case indicating that you’re supposed to prevent only wide-scale quoting of entire emails and email exchanges. – That is your own interpretation of the warning which needs to be confirmed by the Committee. Meanwhile, quoting of illegally accessed emails includes also explaining in ones own words what’s in those emails, which in a way is even worse, because paraphrasing other people is obviously tainted by personal agendas. Cheers,  talk 
Quoting, out-of-context and possibly doctored emails is creating, IMHO, more problems than paraphrasing, as it gives an air of legitimacy to this harassment campaign. PS. Offliner is not the ony party quoting @s, Russavia is doing that as well. | talk  
(edit conflict) I'm charged, as the Clerk of the case, to interpret the directives I receive. Until such a time as I am explicitly overruled by the Committee, how I interpret those directives is how the case will be run. I have interpreted the directives and disallowing the quoting of the contents of emails, allowing the subjects of emails, and allowing the paraphrasing of content of emails where said paraphrasing. If you're concerned about mis-paraphrasing, the other alternative is to give permission to be quoted; otherwise, your emails can and will be paraphrased within reason. If you believe a paraphrase is misleading, you are free to address it in your own evidence section.
These are the rules for the case.   
And in response to Piotrus, either allow yourself to be quoted explicitly, or refute the paraphrasing in your evidence section, or else appeal my decision to the Committee by email to arbcom-l@lists.wikimedia.org. I will be happy to have my interpretation, which is binding on the case absent a contrary directive from th",0,0,0,0,0,0

Quote from the insight book:

The color of the cloak with which Jesus Christ was clothed on the day of his execution has caused some persons to argue that a discrepancy exists in the Bible record with reference to this garment. Matthew said that the soldiers “draped him with a scarlet cloak” (Mt 27:28), while Mark and John say that it was purple. (Mr 15:17; Joh 19:2) However, instead of being a discrepancy, such a variation in describing the garment’s color merely gives evidence of the individuality of the Gospel writers and the fact that they were not in collusion. Matthew described the cloak as it appeared to him, that is, according to his evaluation of color, and he emphasized the garment’s red hue. John and Mark subdued the red tint, calling it purple. “Purple” can be applied to any color having components of both blue and red. So, Mark and John agree with Matthew that the garment was red to some extent. Of course, background and light reflection could have given it different casts. A body of water varies in color at different times, depending upon the particular color of the sky and the reflection of light at a given time. So, when such factors are considered, it is seen that the Gospel writers were not in conflict in describing the color of the cloak that mocking Roman soldiers clothed Christ with on the last day of his human life.",0,0,0,0,0,0

My name is Dean Estes. I met Snakefinger (Mr. Lithman) in 1981 when he and his band played on the front lawn of our high school. One of his band members, a former Dead Kennedy, had attended the school and made this cool event possible. I don't know why Steve Crabtree claims that Lithman was American and was not of European descent. Technically it may be true that the UK is not part of """"Europe"""" despite being a charter member of the EU, but Mr. Crabtree's claims risk giving an false impression. Phil """"Snakefinger"""" Lithman was English, as is easily verified and as was clearly obvious when the man spoke. Perhaps Steve meant that Snakefinger was living in America? (Specifically San Francisco.) Two years later I was fortunate enough to befriend one of The Residents. While I was savvy enough not to ask certain questions until enough trust had been earned, I do recall, during a discussion of the The Residents' remarkably unique sense of harmonization, asking if N. Senada had actually existed. My Resident acquaintance simply smiled and shrugged his shoulders, which I knew was a nice way of saying """"we aren't going there,"""" so I didn't pursue it. I believe it's pretty obvious that """"the mysterious N. Senada"""" never actually existed when you review the various things that have been said about him. Isn't the amusing play on the name of the Baja Mexican town """"Ensenada"""" clue enough? However, this is another case where the question of whether or not such aspects of the Residents mythos """"matter"""" is perfectly valid. Of course it doesn't really matter. As one of the people who actually does know the answers to some of the speculation here, it's so strange, seeing how some people post misinformation with conviction (intentionally?) while others deny facts. For the most part, to quote an old Eno lyric, """"those who know, they don't let it show.""""  -) Mystery and myth are more fun, and I think it's safe to say that's part of the point of the Residents' myriad mysteries. Nevertheless, while Snakefinger protected The Residents' secrets, he wasn't secretive about his own """"real"""" identity or history at all. My apologies to Steve if I've misunderstood him.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

SMOS """"More"""" template
Hi Art, the problem with the extra linefeed with the More template was due to a misplaced  tag on the line after the last part of the template code, which allowed the carriage return at the end of the template code to be included. Shifting the noinclude tag to the end of the previous line cured that problem. The box itself was too big and overlapped with other boxes and with text in sentences above the box. (And it was a bit overbearing and distracting to the reader.) I did a re-design to make it smaller, and wrapped the box formatting only around the word """"More"""" in the template, so it would be the same color as the link text.   TALK  

What do you think of the idea of making the template more generic? That is, don't include the """"MOS:"""" name place, so the template can be used on other projects where a More prompt is useful.

 Ethiopian Airlines 

Hello. May I ask why you removed the fact that the Somaliland region is internationally recognized as an autonomous region of Somalia from the Ethiopian airlines article? You do realize that the airline itself, like the international community as a whole, does not recognize any such country called """"Somaliland"""" and only includes Somalia in its literature (e.g. here), right? In fact, it doesn't even mention Somaliland on its website [2]. So what gives? Is there a second Ethiopian Airlines website I should know about? Also, in your second revert [3], you completely removed the Frequent Flyer Program section that I had just added. What's the point of that too? Why not just revert the Somaliland section if that is all you object to? Why a wholesale revert? Regards, Middayexpress (talk) 

Hi. Thanks for your contributions to Wikipedia. There is an article in Wikipedia for Somaliland where the readers can get all the information they need, including the ones you mention. Wikipedia is simply an encyclopedia, where neutral points of view should be stated. That said, it doesn't matter whether the airline or even Ethiopia recognises Somaliland or not, the only thing that matters is that it flew once to a destination within its territory. Moreover, it doesn't matter to which state (recognised or not even by the UN) Hargeisa is the capital of as to an article concerning any airline, not only Ethiopian. As already stated in the Airline Project guidelines, airline articles as well as pages related to their destinations should only reflect information with neutral points of view. Regarding ShebaMiles, the frequent flyer programme and its description is properly depicted within the codeshare agreements sub-section of the Destinations section, where it is also stated that the company has a codesahre agreement with Lufthansa, as with many other airlines. Scattering information related to the same stuff all through the article renders it disordered. Best wishes.Jetstreamer (talk) 

Thanks for your response. Articles should indeed reflect a neutral point of view. However, removing clarification of the fact that the city of Hargeisa is internationally recognized as a part of Somalia is not neutral. It's actually the opposite of neutral since all of the other images on the Ethiopian Airlines article that show actual Ethiopian Airlines aircraft in various airports around the world all list country-level destinations (viz. United Arab Emirates, England, Ethiopia). They do not list regional-level destinations; only the Hargeisa picture does and that's the point. Unless one wants to deliberately give the impression that Somaliland is recognized as country of its own on par with the aforementioned actual nations, a clarifying note will have to be added indicating that the Somaliland region is actually internationally regarded as a region of Somalia. This is even more necessary considering the fact that Ethiopian Airlines itself doesn't even appear to acknowledge any such sub-national let alone national entity; it only recognizes Somalia in its literature, as shown above (please leave a response if any here so that the discussion is all in one place). Regards, Middayexpress (talk) 

Do you think the last change I made to Ethiopian Airlines destinations solves the issue? Please let me know what you think. I added the flag of Somalia so as to appear with that of Somaliland, and also modified the caption of the last image. Please let me know what you think. Cheers.Jetstreamer (talk) 

That won't do because Somaliland is still listed in the country column alongside actual countries, including the Somalia which it is internationally regarded as an autonomous region of. It is also the only such disputed territory listed on the table and in such a way. That makes the presentation still far from neutral. And that's not even mentioning the main Ethiopian Airlines article, which still requires a clarificatory note, as explained above. Middayexpress (talk) 

Kindly removed Somaliland from the caption of the image in the Ethiopian Airlines article. I think we're done with that. Which is your proposal concerning Ethiopian Airlines destinations? Simply removing a terminated destination is clearly not the solution.Jetstreamer (talk)

9dbd8d8a25e1fba8,"""== Article flagged - could use a photo of a pit bull in attack mode ==

Before we get into discussing this article there is some background information that everyone needs to understand. First,statistically, pit bulls are less agressive (naturally) than, beagles, german shepards and other breeds. Secondly, the dogs only want to please their owners, that is why if you watch the [disgusting] videos of dog fighting you will see 90% of the dogs are wagging their tails because they hear their owner(s) encouraging them to fight. A perfect example is the Michael Vick case, his dogs were taken and put into kennels, as per a federal jury they were not killed because of the [high] profile of the case. Out of the 66 dogs there were taken 8 were put down; which means that is only 12%. Out of the other 58 dogs they have all been adopted to families along with being trained for hospice and hospitals to help raise self esteems on patients. The best saying to sum up the Pit Bull breed is too """"Blame the Deed NOT the Breed"""" which means dont classify ALL pitbulls as fighting agressvie dogs, just the one's that are beaten and treated like crap by the owners and bred for fighting. Pit bulls are NOT agressive by nature. If you look at american history we used to LOVE Pit Bulls, I mean there was Petey (little rascals) and betty boop had a pitbull. Plus many other famous actors/actresses.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  

The article discusses at length the dangerous nature of pit bulls, but lacks a picture of a pit bull attacking or behaving aggressively. The photo of a muzzled pit bull is a start, but is insufficient. I realize it may not be easy to obtain a such a photo in the public domain or by permission, but I'm adding a request in any case.   

 Why does the article need that? Any dog breed can attack.  There's nothing special about the way that a bully breed attacks. The muzzle image is fine; it illustrates that fact that some bully breed individuals do have aggression tendencies which need to be addressed if the dog is in public.  Talk 

 A photo of an agressive dog would be better suited for a dog fighting article.  To place a photo of an aggressive dog in an article describing a breed would be similar to using a photo of a soldier shooting an enemy during war on the Human article...  Or a Jew in a concentration camp, or I suppose a photo of a mugging would compare to animal aggression, but those wouldn't be true to Human character would they?   

Isn't a photo of a muzzled dog more relevant to a discussion of dog muzzling laws? Some places, such as some public parks, require all dogs to be muzzled while attending, regardless of breed, so a photo of a muzzled dog can have different interpretations. As I wrote in my first post, for an article that discusses pit bull attacks, an illustration of such would not be improper to accompany the text. Wikipedia:Images: """"Images must be relevant to the article they appear in and be significantly relative to the article's topic."""" Here are a couple of news media stories that felt it appropriate to use such images: http://www.ktul.com/news/stories/0108/485244.html and http://dallasmorningviewsblog.dallasnews.com/archives/2008/02/mandatory-confi.html. Perhaps a pit bull owner out there would be proud to have such an image of their guard dog in attack mode displayed in the article or perhaps a kennel owner or victim of an attack was able to snap a photo that they would donate and upload to Wikipedia Commons. I remember there used to be a photo of a """"smiling pit bull"""" in the article (see archive Nov 1, 2007). We could return that in the positive press section at the same time to maintain balance.   

A single screenshot image could also be obtained from a television news report about pit bulls and included under fair use. Research: Wikipedia:Image_copyright_tags/Non-free_content and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Non-free_television_screenshot Template:Non-free_tele",0,0,0,0,0,0

Nicely said! XD  I'd also like to add that it's official that Shadow does care about Rouge, but we don't know why, or to what extent.  While myself and others like to speculate in other places, all that should be mentioned here is the citable facts for both situations and letting the reader decide.  Also, this does not involve dropping biased little hints in the relay. (What the HELL is up with Rouge's bit on Knuckles's page?  But anywho, there needn't be a """"relationship"""" section for anyone other that Amy.  If you must document something it should be dealings with other characters that heavily affect the one being discussed.  

Examples:
On Amy's page, her obsession and dealings with Sonic should be mentioned, as it's a focal point of her character.

On Sonic's page, Tails should be mentioned as the two are a speedy Dynamic duo.  Vice versa for Tails's page.

Also, like it or not, Shadow's dealings with Rouge do factor into his character.  Simply put, she brings out the best in him.

Silver's page should include his dealings with Blaze as he's been shown to be quite emotional concerning her.

The proposal is to split the article into Reading to Taunton Line, Exeter to Plymouth Line and Bristol to Exeter Line which would include a merger of Bristol to Taunton Line with the Taunton-Exeter sections in this article. The main advantages for this are;

1) The three articles would more accurately represent the history of the lines in question. This article includes the Berks and Hants Railway as well as only a small section of the Bristol to Exeter Railway and the South Devon Railway. Three articles concerning the modern day equivalents of these railways would be a better basis for the articles than the arbitrary cut-offs that are currently employed.

2)The three articles would more accurately tie-in with other articles. For example, the article Disused railway stations (Bristol to Exeter Line) would cover all closed stations from a single article instead of the one and a quarter that it currently does.

3)The articles will more accurately mirror current services, this especially applies to CrossCountry services that only operate between Bristol and Plymouth and South West Trains that only operate between Exeter and Plymouth.

Elvenscout, I derive no pleasure from taking this action, but the fact is, no matter whether Tristan didn't edit for a month or to or not, that you made those edits to the articles I pointed at, and perhaps others, right after Tristan did, and they were articles you never edited before. It is not my job to point out that a specific ban, and bans are typically tailored to the situation, differs from the general, standard ban: after all, one of your initial complaints was that Tristan followed you to certain articles, if I remember correctly. An interaction ban is a two-way street, and what goes for the one mutatis mutandis goes for the other. If the shoe were on the other foot I'd have blocked Tristan.One more thing: you are free to list your complaints in essay form or with bullet points and emoticons, but not on Wikipedia. See """"Exceptions"""" to WP:IBAN, though: given that Tristan is free to drop a complaint about you on my talk page, so are you; moreover, if you feel that this ban, you may do so, pace """"no commenting on each other anywhere"""", by """"addressing a legitimate concern about the ban itself in an appropriate forum"""". WP:AN is the right place for that. Moreover, if Tristan's behavior needs to be discussed because you wish to argue, for instance, that their behavior in combination with the ban makes your work impossible, I suppose that would fall within the purview of the exception as well (at WP:AN), but you'd have to be prepared to have your own edits, including the appeal/complaint, scrutinized as well.

 Re: Block Log on user 62.171.198.5 

Sir, I wish to ask if you would consider extending the ban on this IP for the persistent and annoying way they seem to wish to disrupt the wikipedia.  Previous bans of 24 and 31 hours have obviously slowed things down, but the IP is reported as belonging to Research Machines Inc, and its understood that abuse of this IP would result in reports of network abuse to be passed to them.  

The IP has an extraordinarily long list of vandalism attached to its name, and I can barely find one edit under the user contributions which is not, or does not amount to outright vandalism.  Could I please ask therefore that you consider extending this ban to 48 hours or thereabouts.  Previous bans seem to have had no effect since the talk page for this IP is full of bans and vandalism warnings.  

Please understand that I would never question the decision of an administrator, as I am not one myself and would consider that the height of rudeness.  All I ask is whether you could please reconsider the ban and possibly extend it.  Thank you.    Thor's pet yack

 WikiMarkup 

Wikipedia has it's own special """"language"""" called """"WikiMarkup"""". It is very important, therefore, to know a good deal of it when you begin to write an article.

 Links 
 External links 
An external link is a link that goes to another website, besides Wikipedia. They are formatted like this: [Name of website goes here].
For example: [http://www.google.com] becomes . 
To display alternate text for an external link, type [Name of website goes here Alternate text goes here]. Note the space between the website's name and the alternate text.
For example: [http://www.google.com Google search engine] becomes Google search engine.

 Internal links 
An internal link is a link that links to any page within Wikipedia. They are formatted like this:[[Name of page goes here]]
For example: [[Giraffe]] becomes Giraffe.
An internal link can display alternate text through the use of a pipe character """"|""""
For example: [[Giraffe|A long-necked animal that lives on the plains of Africa]]. becomes A long-necked animal that lives on the plains of Africa.
Normal text can also be blended into a link.
For example: I like [[Giraffe]]s. becomes I like Giraffes.
Internal links can link across namespaces.
For example: [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view]] becomes Wikipedia:Neutral point of view.
They can also use Pipe tricks.
For example: [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view|]] (note the pipe character before the two end brackets) becomes Neutral point of view
For example: [[Orange (fruit)|]] becomes Orange.

 Redirects 

A redirect is a page that, if accessed, sends you to a related page automagically. For an example of this, see Gill net. Note how at the top of the page it says (Redirected from Gill net). Voila!
For example: #REDIRECT [[United States]] redirects whatever page it was on to United States.

Thank you AnthonyBradbury your comments made sense. The issues I raised relate to the ANI thread still remaining open. Both Erpert,  NEEnt, and now you as an administrator have said that the matter is 'closed.' 

Despite me being blocked 5 days ago and despite Erpert closing the thread and stating no further comments, another editor whatamidoing, removed that and continued making false, baseless claims, quoting inaccurate details, that easily be proved. Further, entirely separate matters, to what my block was for, are now being discussed 'after' I was blocked. Without me having an opportunity to present clear contrary evidence based purely on the objective editing history. And have a fair minded neutral and independent administrator to judge both sides. 

These editors knew there was a ANI thread, but did not comment for 2 days until I was blocked. After I was blocked they then and only then, stuck the boot in, without any facts to back up their false claims. They may have waited until I was blocked because these baselss claims would have been proven false immediately, through me providing diffs and objective facts to the contrary. In fact, they only ceased when I asked for a temporary unblock above to respond! They would have kept 'hammering away' with baseless false claims, providing no facts to back them up and all the while, me being unable to provide the facts. 

I have made some very solid edits to numerous articles. I respect Wikipedia. I respect Wikipedia's policies. I accept the reasons for my current block and would appreciate, after such a significant period, ie. 2 full weeks, to start afresh and be provided an assumption of good faith in my editing rather than editors judging me already. I think all editors, after being blocked should be given the benefit of the doubt. Not to have this thrown in their face for ever more. That's not right. 

I know a lot about some topics. Very little about other topics. My reliable sources have good. My editing and additions have been good. Productive in many different articles. I completely reject being 'incompetent' as whatamidoing states, without me being able to respond. Simply because of differing points of view. I understand whatamidoing and Bilby are very experienced editors who have made great contributions to Wikipedia as editors. No-one is disputing that. They obviously gain a great deal of enjoyment from the project too! Does that provide these editors 'unequal' rights over less experienced editors who are also adding value to the project? Where they can make false baseless assumptions? I realise I have had some previous conflict with the same small group of editors in the past. But that says nothing about my edits being productive and of benefit to the project. 

I believe strongly in the principles of assuming good faith amongst editors. I did not think blocks were punitive whereby other editors can 'mock' the person who has been blocked? Nor are blocks an opportunity to make false, entirely baseless assumptions about an editor's competence. Is the ANI thread closed or is it not closed please AnthonyBradbury?

Fair use rationale for Image:Thesecitiesourgravescover.jpg

Thanks for uploading or contributing to Image:Thesecitiesourgravescover.jpg. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. In addition to the boilerplate fair use template, you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use. Suggestions on how to do so can be found  here.

Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale. Using one of the templates at Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline is an easy way to insure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template.  Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page. 

If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the """"my contributions"""" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting """"Image"""" from the dropdown box. Note that any fair use images uploaded after 4 May, 2006, and lacking such an explanation will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on criteria for speedy deletion.

What you were up to, you mean. From the beginning you're personally attacking me and harassing me, and this is the only way you found to try to claim ownership of articles.
And yes, it's highly suspicious that you seem to monitor everything that happens between the IP and me. At worst, it shows that you're actually tracking down my edits, ie harassing me, at best, it proves you are the IP because without any communication with me or the IP, there is no way you can be aware of anything in so much details(unless you're harassing me). And no, that you happen to hear about this matter right after it occured, while nothing suggested you were active here for 2 days, cannot be coincidence.
And finally, please, Buspar, stop playing on words. This is what the admin that took in charge your SSP case stated, and nothing else: """"Looking at contribs, User:Buspar and User:Xuanwu are very probably the same user. Technically, they cannot be socks, as one username was created after the other stopped editing"""". 
This statement is based on the technical definition of sockpuppetry, meaning that a person is using different identities at the same time. The admin only noted that the 2 accounts were not used simultaneously, but nonetheless acknowledged that Buspar and Xuanwu were the same person (""""Looking at contribs, User:Buspar and User:Xuanwu are very probably the same user."""")
The admin, however, never confirmed that you were not the IPs Onethirtyeightdot suspected you to be. If you've seen the line """"No, Buspar is not 130.49.157.75"""", then please source it correctly.

So, what do we have ? An admin confirming you're likely to use several identities, an anonymous IP acting in exactly the same way as you do, having the same personal issues with me, editing the very same articles as you do, reverting back into articles the very same contribs that you made, and it also seems both you and the IP seem to have a telepathic link allowing to know every issue occuring with the IP without you being contacted by it beforehand.

As I've said, I'm offering to peacefully resolve this problem. 
I am sincerely convinced that Buspar is the IP, because I've noticed the very same edit pattern, because both users contribute to the same articles, and both users seem to have a personal issue against me and both seem to systematically revert my contributions as soon as they concern article about illegal downloading.
Thus, this is not randmon bad faithed accusation. This is only what I sincerely believe.

However, if it is absolutely proved that Buspar and the Ip are not the same and that Buspar and the IP don't behave in similar ways, then I'm ready to make excuses to both users and to stop identifying the Ip as Buspar. 

But if someone has any doubts about the IP identity, or if someone clearly acknowledge that Buspar and the Ip have the very same behavior and edit pattern, then that's all I need. I won't continue to call the IP Buspar, on the condition that an admin clearly acknowledges the IP¨as being Buspar, and that Buspar in his future edits, only revert edits of mine and talk to me under his Buspar username.

  I remember the registered account better, so I'll take him first. The PA was from two days ago, and I have a hard time blocking someone for something done that long ago, particularly since no one acted on it in the meantime. His edit today goes back to something I said at AN yesterday about American admins, me included, being clueless about football and footballers. I don't know if the edit he made today is good or not - I know there's a timestamp you guys use and it looks like he updated that, so it's not clear vandalism to me. (More on that in a sec.)
 To your IPs: the first IP hasn't edited today at all, and the second has made one edit today. That may be long term disruption, but it's not current vandalism. The reports sat for several hours with no action, and it's become our practice at AIV to clear the old and/or stale reports after, say, five or six hours. If they're sitting there that long with that many people watching and no one has acted yet, they're not going to, and any vandalism or disruption from those accounts has stopped (or never started in the first place - you'd be surprised).

 Khwarizmi being Persian: Original research, which has nothing to do with Wikipedia 

Let's look into the Persians' claims, shall we?

Zmmz lists Merriam-Webster with this quote: """"Function: biographical name circa 780-circa 850 Muhammad ibn MusA al-KhwArizmI Islamic (Persian-born) mathematician & astronomer; one of the greatest scientific minds of Islam; source of much of mathematical knowledge of medieval Europe"""".

 Notice, it says """"Persian-born"""" in parantheses, and gives Islamic as the nationality. Basically, they defined him by religion and stated his place of birth. He was born in Khwarizm, in the Khorasan province. At the time of his birth, it was part of the Arab Islamic Caliphate, now it's part of the Uzbegistan nation-state. Alas, Persians burnt us saying that it's in fact Persian, so let's take it as Persian. Now, according to sources cited by Heja Helwada, Khorasan in general had a huge Arab population. In accordance to that, defining him as Persian simply because he was born in Khorasan, is not only disputed at best, it also constitutes OR(original research) which is against Wiki's policy, see: WP:NOR

A troll showed up lately and claimed that Arabs are fighting a losing battle, I'm not sure we're in a battle-field here, but I got the gist: he thinks we have no sources...poor little guy!

Sources that state he's explicitly an Arab:

a27e45601c52f25a,"""Punishment, by itself, cannot produce a system of control. Expectation must exist in the subject along with fear of not reaching this expectation. Punishment and deception are tools used to create this fear.

Everyone involved with this case realizes that deception exists - they understand that Carbonite and David Gerard are mischaracterizing my actions in order to build a case, but they don't know why. Why would they be trying so hard to pretend that I'm """"persistently behaving in a disruptive way"""" when all evidence is to the contrary? Why would they push to bring this thing to trial when they know that they can't point to a single instance of """"disruption"""" that is enforced equilaterally ?

The Wikimedia Foundation Privacy Policy can shed some light on the issue.
It is the policy of Wikimedia that personally identifiable data collected in the server logs will not be released by the developers who have access to it, except as follows:

In response to a valid subpoena or other compulsory request from law enforcement 
With permission of the affected user 
To Jimbo Wales, his legal counsel, or his designee, when necessary for investigation of abuse complaints. 
Where the information pertains to page views generated by a spider or bot and its dissemination is necessary to illustrate or resolve technical issues. 
Where the user has been vandalising articles or persistently behaving in a disruptive way, data may be released to assist in the targeting of IP blocks, or to assist in the formulation of a complaint to relevant Internet Service Providers 
Where it is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of the Wikimedia Foundation, its users or the public.

Here we see that the Wikimedia privacy policy allows administrators to snoop on an editor when they have first established that the editor is """"persistently behaving in a disruptive way."""" It therefore becomes important to create a case against the editor before researching the developer database for his private information. This isn't just a matter of ethics. Laws such as the California Online Privacy Protection Act of 2003 make it illegal for a website to violate their own privacy statement.

The Cabal is hoping that vague innuendo will be enough to create an official case. After they gain the legal right to snoop my personal information, they will be free to reveal what they already know. Don't be surprised to hear something along the lines of, """"We had no idea about this before the case opened, but look what we have discovered now that we have a legal right to investigate the personal information about this editor!""""

Of course, none of the information they reveal will be direct or a threat to Wikipedia in any way, but it will be enough to hang me in the court of public opinion. We all have skeletons in our closet. The danger in giving our representatives a full set of keys to our personal lives is that they can't help sneaking a peek in the closet, even when they have no ethical or legal right to do so.

You Need To Change Your Username Or you Will Be be Blocked
[edit] Instructions
First, take a look at the username policy to make sure the username you are requesting is appropriate. Also, please note that for technical reasons, your username cannot begin with a lowercase letter, nor can it contain any underscores. 
Check to make sure the username you are requesting is not already taken. Do this by searching for the name in this list. If the name appears in the list, even if the link is red it is taken. Do not create an account under the new name. We'll do that for you. 
Log in with your present username in order to place your request. Renames will not be approved if the requestee is not logged in. 
Click here to place a request. 
Replace the text """"CURRENT"""" with your present username. 
Replace """"NEW"""" with the username to which you wish to be renamed. 
Fill in a reason where indicated but do not add anything in the """"subject/headline"""" box. 
If that doesn't work, simply copy the following text to your computer's 'clipboard': 
 CURRENT → NEW 

 Reason: Reason for requested renaming.   
Go to the """"Requests"""" section of this page, click the """"edit"""" link, and paste the text at the very bottom. Modify it as indicated above. 
Make sure that you have spelled both names correctly. Save the page. 
Check back periodically to answer any questions that may arise regarding your request. Do not be surprised if you suddenly cannot log in to your old account; this merely indicates that you should log in under your new name as the request has been fulfilled. 
Please be patient. It may take a few days for your request to be completed. 

Effects of a username change 
When the rename has been completed, your account will have been renamed, and any contributions you have made (including deleted contributions) will be reattributed to your new account as a background process. Your account preferences, watchlist contents, password, etc. will all be preserved, and your user and user talk pages will have been moved to the new name. 
Note: The process responsible for reallocating old contributions is currently dependent upon the job queue mechanism. As such, you may find old contributions do not immediately appear under your new account; this is perfectly normal. Updates should take at most a day to complete, although the length of time will vary according to the size of the job queue on this wiki, and the status of the server processes which process this queue. 
The change will appear in the user rename log and the request will be moved to the archives in the interest of transparency. It is not possible to rename accounts without an entry being created in the log. 
This change will not affect signatures you have already left on talk pages, or other places where you signed your username with   . Those pages will continue to display your signature (including the link to your old username) unless edited manually. 
Be aware: Once you have been renamed, your old account will no longer exist and may potentially be recreated by a third party. This is true even if your old account pages have been redirected towards your new account. To guard against impersonation, you may wish to recreate the old account yourself.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Nice Try

The Idea of wikipedia is to present facts, not your opinions about the incumbant Mayor or the attempted highjacking of the Democratic Party. Granted you have a problem with Mayor Longo, as you make this clear every time you open your mouth at the Council Meetings (which provide for great entertainment as you seem to enjoy making a fool of yourself). Your opinions on red light cameras are off base as your candidate has yet to come up with a better solution to raise funds to get us out of fiscal emergency. In fact, Mr Wagner has no plan at all except to claim he will stop forclosures in the city- this is a national problem that the federal government cant stop let alone the would be Mayor of Garfield Hts. Mr Wagner goes around telling people whatever they want to hear in order to get their votes. Including but not limited to offering political patronage jobs to anyone willing to support him.

    Hi Wally, not sure if you are picking things up on my talk page, so talking with you here.

Thanks for your rapid response.  Proper thanks given on my talk page where you left feedback.

The User Astrotrain is still vandalising my work.  To try and shake him off my tail I have given him notice that he is violating Trade Marks, the word Astrotrain is a Trade Mark of Katara in Japan, but that user still persists in attacking my work using that illegal user name.  

I think agreement has been reached with other users by removing all personal links from my image pages pending a decision from Wikipedia image licencing specialists and you as a mediator even though I have not mentioned your user name.  One user ALR has been very good in tidying up the presentation of one of my images, after initally attacking me.

But Astrotrain is just deleting my work anyway. I do not know how to proceed with recommending the blocking of Astrotrain but that user is violating international law on the use of Trade Marks and possibly exposing Wikipedia to legal action from Katara's lawers. Astrotrain needs to be blocked for legal reasons, but it would probably also be useful for that user to go through the process of starting again. That user has a documented history of destroying other peoples work and holding back the development of Wikipedia on several articles there is a need for that user to re-evaluate its contribution to Wikipedia and personal agenda.  I wish Astrotrain well with a new user name.

Anyway. It occurs to me that there must be thousands of photographers in the world, many-many much more competent than me, who would be willing to release their prized pictures to Wikipedia for free Wikipedia use only.  Much of the world is lacking in education and information. The world's poorest only hope in the short term is """"technology leap"""" e.g. skipping the benefit of a free national press and going straight to the Internet with Wikipedia being a prime source of unbiased information. But not making pictures and information available from the professionals ensures that third world countries will only get second rate information, this will not help them. And on the contrary could be counterproductive to their development by holding back information.  Photographers often appear an arrogant breed, but deep down they are artists; caring people.  Perhaps Wikipedia should be calling on photographers around the world to make their contribution to the eradication of starvation and improved standards of living through education and Wikipedia. Hopefully this is not just soapbox but a constructive suggestion that can be the seed of something useful.  Des  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

a3ad7f2a01b9d1cf,"The old taxobox template? 
Hi!

I know you are busy with the cactus, but I hope you can help me out. On the Norwegian Wikipedia, we have since the beginning used a taxobox without ranks. This has been due to early influence from a single editor, which has since gone unchallenged until a year ago or so. Now, we finally have the consensus to change over to a ranked system, the only problem is that there seem to be no-one capable (or willing) of doing the coding of something as complex as a taxo-box. The bio-editors over at Norwegian WP are just just a handful of people, all of which seem to be as techically inclined as yours truly.

So, I had the bright idea to import and translate the old (non-auto) taxobox from English. I don't know anything about coding, but since the ranks are in latin, I suppose it should be possible to understand what bits need translation. The only problem is, I don't know how to find the code. Do you have access to it? If so, would it be possible for you to post the code on this test page?",0,0,0,0,0,0

Depp remembers, """"He saved it all. Not only is [the book] true, but there's more. And it was worse.

Later on under the sub heading Reaction, it says:
Apparently it all came flooding back to him, he was reliving the whole trip! He was yelling out and jumping on his seat like it was a rollercoaster, ducking and diving, shouting 'SHIT! LOOK OUT! GODDAM BATS!' That was fantastic – if he thought we'd captured it, then we must have done it.

a) those women that worked voluntarily or because they had no other options
b) those taken forcibly

 How and when did the system change?

 * Missing elements;

 a) the local agents, criminal underworlds and government bureaucracies that became involved, i.e. both Chinese and Korean
 b) the roots or context of the phenomenon, e.g. women in the slave caste of Korea, the system of local agents in Asia buying and selling daughters (it equally existed in Japan as well).
 c) its legacy afterwards in the industrialization of the Korean sex industry after WWII, e.g. the same comfort women working in prostitution for the American occupational forces and the Korean army. To state the obvious, the women and system did not just disappear post-WWII.
 d) The reason and role of General Park Chung Hee's regime, the Korean Censorship Board etc in the suppression discussion of the issue leading to the burial of the issue until it arose again in the 80s and 90s.

Alright, we've witnessed an administrative demonstration of power as with the """"protection"""" of the article; thanks Bundy, for your kind warning. Can we now constructively return to the matter in hand? After all, it is the task of all of us Wikipedians to see to it that articles contained in this Free Encyclopedia adhere to encyclopedical standards and not those of the yellow press, isn't it? 'Free' should not stand for 'free of correct facts', 'free of truth(fulness)' or for that matter 'free of ethical restraints'. One would think we all, at least those of good will among us, agree on that. Now it happens to be the case, if not by willful disruptive tendentious editing then by negligence, that in its current state the article Francesco Carotta is full of errors of all sorts and easily verifiably so, some of which were mentioned in the previous, now """"deleted"""" comment. Especially the section on the """"Dutch media controversy"""" is a complete distortion of the real events, for instance, the review of Peter Veldhuisen was not related at all to the activities and pronouncements of van Hooff. This section needs a thorough revision, or maybe the best thing to do would be to just delete it, since it does not provide any information on the theory and might be of interest only to the yellow press. Furthermore, we the Populares, the People's Front of Rome so to speak, hope that it is not considered a personal attack if we dare to ask the reputable user Rubenstein what exactly he thinks it is that qualifies him to act as the expert for and supervisor over this particular article. If User:Slrubenstein does not deem us worthy of an answer, as has been the case a few times on this page, maybe other editors or just readers could try to help us understand. In any case, we fail to see why Slrubenstein's arbitrary words and deeds should carry any special weight for the decent normal Wikipedians. We also don't understand why there seems to be so little opposition to what appears to be his self-arrogated authority.
So in closing we ask an unbiased and honest administrator—there certainly must be one around here—to remove the editing protection from the article so that some much needed reasonable work can be done by knowledgeable and sincere editors. In order to prevent tedious unfruitful edit wars we suggest to discuss changes to the article on this talk page first. —   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

In chapter nine Burlington, Vermont Kolbert writes about Burlington, Vermont’s largest city. Years ago the citizens decided to stand up to global warming by using less power instead of buying more. The mayor of Burlington, Peter Clavelle, who has been mayor since 1989, came up with a program that encourages contractors to engage not in demolition but in “deconstruction”. This helps the city save energy by reducing waste and cutting down the need for new materials. Burlington’s electric department (BED) has a wind turbine that provided enough power for thirty homes and gets half of its energy from renewable sources, such as its 50 megawatt power plant that runs off of wood chips. The BED also leases compact florescent light bulbs for twenty cents a month because a family who uses these bulbs can cut their electricity bill by 10 percent. The city of Burlington estimates that their energy saving projects over the course of this lifetime will prevent the release of 175,000 tons of carbon. Burlington residents also eat locally and have turned old waste sites into an assortment of community gardens and cooperatives, the waste from these gardens is taken to a composting factory, and turned back into soil, making this process “closed loop”. Clavelle’s plan has begun to pick up across America beginning with Greg Nickles, the mayor of Seattle, who created a set of principles called the “US Mayors Climate Protection Agreement”. This agreement has been signed by over a hundred and seventy mayors, representing about thirty – six million people.

Adding is far less likely to step on toes than subtracting. Other editors will judge the quality of your work and you'll gain acceptance as one of the team. Then when you've established your credibility, try re-organising existing material - amalgamate material that deals with the same subject but might appear in different sections, shorten paragraphs and improve syntax, and so on - but always trying not to delete more than is essential, and trying also to retain wikilinks. Finally, suggest deletion of any material you think is irrelevant or otherwise doesn't belong - this is where you'll probably find you have to compromise the most.

a50c184445951ed7,"Misrepresenting administrator scope 

Please take care not to misrepresent how administrators are expected to act, or any other policy in the future - administrators do not make content decisions. What you quoted was particular only to discretionary sanctions which are only applicable in certain arbitration cases. You view has therefore been moved again to the talk page.   

Please take care not to engage in misrepresentation - you are not outside of this dispute, and your quote was particular to discretionary sanctions. Administrators do not make content decisions. See below. Please also do not change my view - I suggest you revert your latest edit - failure to do so will result in administrator intervention for deliberate misrepresentation, misuse of the dispute resolution process and vandalism.   
 

You are welcome to your view, but you are not welcome to misrepresent administrator policy or to change my view.   

You have engaged in misrepresentation, perhaps out of misunderstanding. Administrators are only allowed to make discretionary sanctions in arbitration cases where they are explicitly allowed to - Kirill's comment was in relation to discretionary sanctions only (check the context of his comment; the heading under which he made it). FloNight's comment is in relation to administrator enforcement in general, which is why the SAB remedy has been proposed in the homeopathy case.   

It is only disruptive where there is edit-warring - that is, edit-warring against consensus (separate policy on conduct). NO administrator has made blocks for violations of WP:NPOV, WP:V, and WP:NOR because they can be desysopped for making a rulings on content - for which they do not have the authority. Would you like arbitrator clarification?   

Did you read what I said above? NO administrator has made blocks for violations of WP:NPOV, WP:V, and WP:NOR because they can be desysopped for making a rulings on content - for which they do not have the authority. See also: . 
Discussing content issues at a conduct Rfc is inappropriate - we have a clear distinction between Article Rfc and Rfc on user conduct for that reason. What is acceptable is pointing editors to an Article RFC so editors can comment on content (and hence address content issues), and that is where discussion of those issues belong in the dispute resolution process.   

So please modify your view so that there is no misrepresentation of policy/norms as it has been sanctioned by the Committee in the past (and admins have been sanctioned when using their position to make a ruling on content). Article RFC is where comment is made on the content policies you have quoted - you are welcome to direct a link to the discussion there in your view so that it is dealt with.   

It seems you don't get the point - it's ok if you think it should be enforceable, but it is completely irresponsible to misrepresent policy by saying that it must be enforcible when it is forbidden. Also, it contributes to the confusion editors have about Wikipedia norms and policies, and it is unacceptable. Therefore, I am referring it directly to the Committee.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Some of the material in the talk page is personal. The page includes rough drafts with mistakes that I never intended to make permanent. Had I known I would not be allowed to delete this material, I would never have posted it in the first place.

You recently archived part of the page, which is fine, of course. I told you at that time that I planned to clear the whole page, as I do from time to time.

In the account from St. Luke's Gospel read at the Catholic Liturgy for Passion/Palm Sunday (Luke 22:14 – 23: 56) we heard of the encounter between Jesus and His captors in that Garden called Gethsemane. There, one of his disciples sought to wield a sword of violence to repel the authorities. It is absolutely clear in this account where Jesus - and thus His Church - stand on the improper use of the sword - outside of legitimate self defense.""""

 Could there be another sub-section called """"International and comestic Reactions""""? 

I think it is pertinent to the article at this stage.

The Global Times (a Chinese daily apparently suffused with a glaring nationalistic view) article further said that while India's path for boosting its military strength has not met too many obstacles, the country is still poor (as if China is not) and lags behind in infrastructure construction (of course it does).

In Delhi, diplomatic sources in the Chinese embassy said, 

As a side note, India needs to take more consideration of external threats. And it seems naive to think that India can continue to develop as a global economic power without also bringing its defence capabilities up to the standards of other nations in the region. From our POV it seems poverty should be their priority, but the UK, US etc all have poverty and still spend billions on effective defence measures.

 Jorge Gracie 
The article was deleted via a 3-2 vote.  This isn't a consensus but rather a small majority. I have seen quite often when a 3-2 vote did not result in deletion but the talk of no consensus reached.   Additionally, many individuals in the articles for deletion noted Jorge via MMAnote rather than MAnote .   At worst, I would like to have this article userfied.  Thank you.    
Rough Consensus on wikipedia is about balancing arguments against consensus not policy. So on one hand we had keep votes arguing against an inherent notability that didn't have a policy background and a delete side that was arguing that the subject did not meet the GNG/inclusion guideline because the sources were inadequate. The sources brought up in the discussion did not seem to meet the GNG so I was left with policy based arguments to delete and non-policy based arguments to keep. That gives a rough consensus to delete. I'm always happy to userfy. Where would you like it.  Humbug! 
Fully disclosing my biases toward keep on this issue, I agree with  that you made an erroneous decision on this one. I'm no admin, but the debate appears fully in the midst of no consensus, which as you well know, in deletion discussions, normally results in the article, page, image, or other content being kept. I find it confusing that you would say that the keep votes didn't have a specific policy foundation in mind when I specifically and intentionally addressed WP:BASIC as the guildeline (particularly because this was a bio) and then listed a recently published book, black belt magazine, and (least but not irreverently so) the BJJ heroes biography as sources which achieve this guideline. If, for whatever reason, you find the more prime WP:GNG to be the true standard of retention for this article, well I see no reason why it does not equivalently square with nor meet the standards set forth in WP:BASIC. I say this in due respect sir.   
I'm a bit confused BASIC is a simplification of the GNG, Please can you explain which sources are suitable to determine notability in this case? Thanks,.   Humbug! 
Good sir, I'm a bit flummoxed as to what it is about the glut of sources that ISN'T particularly suitable for you. Is it the """"Significant coverage"""" or some other such sub-section of the GNG specifically? I believe that this source would have more than met that. I mention WP:BASIC specifically because this is (was) a biography and BASIC pertain to biographies specifically. Most critically is the section: """"If the depth of coverage in any given source is not substantial (as many of these sources admittedly were not), then multiple independent sources may be combined to demonstrate notability, which the at least dozen or so sources DID in a non-trivial manner. Now I know I'm not a administrator, and I don't have the permissions nor presumably knowledge to adjudicate these affairs, but I do casually work on more than enough bios to know that when the majority of all biographies (take this as an example) are FAR less cited and left kept or otherwise unmolested clearly there is a double standard in effect here.   
I have reviewed the sources. Have you read the guideline on reliable sourcing The only reliable source in the deleted article was the book reference and that was roughly 100 words. That and fan sites does not a wikipedia biography make. Also see Other stuff exists.  Humbug! 
You can userfy it over here.  I will update it and improve it. Buddy23Lee you can perform fixes to it as well.  Make it a complete article. https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:CrazyAces489/jorgegracie

You declined semi on 2011 Cricket World Cup; I then went in and applied PC protection. I guess I wasn't wheel-warring, but I still feel I owe you an explanation.

 Trivia lesson  

Ok, I’m going to enjoy this… Here we go, amateur. You can reply where I indicated between paregraph so that the disscusion can be more organized:

1. Rupert Thorne was a recurring villain in a Kingpin fashion from the 2nd half of the 70's until the Crisis came. Then he was forgotten and then saved by Timm in the 90's for the animated series. Falcone is just a recurring name Frank Miller and Jeph Loeb use when he needs to mention Gotham City mafia. Carmine, was never a lead villain like Rupert has been. If you accuse me of just watching the animated series (which I deny) I can acuse you of just getting exited because of the Carmine appearance in the last movie. Maroni is just a support guy for Two-Face's story, as Tony Zucco is for Robin's (who is the nerd defending minor characters and bragging about how he knows nick names everybody knows, like """"Boss"""" and """"roman"""" , now? heh, heh, heh)

Reply:

2. every single comment can be sourced. Appealing to whom, for example is the easiest comment to source if you want to waste your time like that. Just check how many batman titles are published every single month and how many people buys against any other superhero's books. You will learn that monthly, the amount of baman books sold is good enough to call the mythos appealing. That's why there are 6 motion pictures, 2 animated series (without jl and superfriends and even scooby-doo appearances by joker, riddler, scarecrow and penguin) and, live action show and several internet about batman, his foes and his mythos. That's why the mythos is so appealing.

Reply:

3. Catwoman is dangerous. Following your logic maybe mr zsasz would be batman's worst enemy. Being a killer doesn’t make an enemy notable as his protagonism and his importance in the mind of Batman and Batman readers, writers and creators does. Knowing Batman's identity and not being completely on the good side makes her even more important. You seem new to the comics’ world, do you really think Catwoman is going to be Holly for so long? Context, PC, context. Selina has been a main character for more than 60 years, I’m talking about all those years. Not about the comic book you just bought on the corner store last week, my """"mate"""". Following again your line of thought, it not worth saying Nixon was a president because he is dead. We couldn’t say Adam West was Batman because that show is of. And you called my ways childish…

Reply:

4. I think you might be confused. We are talking about Batman. You might be thinking of some other superhero. In batman comics bets are that, if you buy a batman comic from any year at random, or watch any episode form any batman series, also at random, The Joker, Catwoman, the Penguin, the Riddler or Two-face are going to be the main villain. If you get the croc, or scar-face, the mad-hatter you are loki, and if you catch you hero the """"Roman"""" you are really, really a lottery winner. By the way there it’s something called figurative speech, and it means to compare situations, I dunno if they told you. They are not literary on a race.

Reply:

5. Hugo, the Scarecrow and the Hatter are influential because, whenever they appear, the story goes on a deeper lever exploring Batman's mind and messing with it. Those characters are useful tools when a writer wants to analyze Batman. Besides, I don't know if you are capable of using your imagination, I’m sure you can, it’s an indispensable tool for getting into the story when you read, but if someone messes with your mind on the level they have messed with Batman’s , that'll probably leave some ugly emotional scars on you... good thing he is the Batman. Therefore, they do get to be influential in a way. Thinking they don't get to appear as much as the five previous, therefore they are not influential is just wrong

6. I put the first Clayface after mentioning that the previous are important. Don't make me doubt of your reading skills. How ever Basil Karlo has been important on and off and he started the Clayface concept and we have to point that. You talked about context to me, marking the appearance of the 1st Clayface, as I did, is context.

7. I could doubt words I used like hot, sexy, bimbo and many other, that I once and again asked everyone to edit if they don't happen to like them. But I think is safe to say their creators intentions were to make those female characters look like that. Didn't you notice the curves in the drawings? I dunno about you but for most guys that could be a hot bimbo.

a850e796d78297be,"Cabalist team of sysops/users undermines WP’s reliability  promoting Greek nationalistic POV 
A well collaborated group of 2 WP sysops and 8 WP users has been spotted working systematically in full daily basis to promote ultra natioanalistic Greek POV. They intervene in any related  new articles, make Greek POV edits, edit wars, reverts, deletions, block users, merges and redirects. Their main target is political articles about Rebublic of Macedonia, Turkey, Bulgaria, Albania, their minorities in Greece and Greek history. 

Khoikhoi (sysop) and Future Perfect at Sunrise (sysop)  recently deleted article: Voden inscription, and protected articles as Minorities in Greece and Bulgarian Human Rights in Macedonia. They also redirected new articles as  Bulgarian minority in Greece to Minorities of Greece, Bulgarians in Greece to Minorities in Greece and Tarlis incident  to Treaty of Sevres without warning and discussion. 

All  redirects don’t  allow traces . Practically this action is equivalent to speady deletion because redirected articles are not included to target articles and  prevents recreating them under same name.

List of abusers  involved: 

user:Khoikhoi (sysop,) He has been probated and unprobated
 user:Future Perfect at Sunrise (sysop)  
 user:Aldux 
 user:Tekleni
 user:Telex
 user:NikoSilver 
 user:Euthymios 
 user:Hectorian 
 user:Politis
 user:Miskin 

Some of them are suspected employees of Greek National Intelligence Service (E.Y.Π.). Other are suspected  members of ultra natioanalistic organizations of Greek interests.

The situation has become unacceptible. Check their  “contributions” and act  properly. User:prespan",0,0,0,0,0,0

CJ DUB Keeps Calling Users Ignorant - Violation of Wiki Rules
Hi, Deb. The user, CJ DUB continues to break Wiki rules by disrespecting others by insulting me. He stated the following, yet again: You are in fact ignorant. He also claims to be an editor """"with experience"""". A serious wiki editor with experience does not speak so ignorantly and disrespectfully about others. A wiki editor examines facts without judging others, as is the case in discriminatory environments. Therefore, he is not a wiki editor and is most likely a poser. He seems to be a sensitive american """"man"""" who feels everyone is against him or his american way of thinking. He must understand that not everyone will like him or his background. I have also noticed that another user named, Seb, may be the same person. He's probably using dual usernames in wiki. 
As a result of the above valid points, I urge blocking him for a long while so he learns to respect others on this forum. Again, he's broken wiki rules on respect for others 3 times. Thank you.

They're both distinct from account-based money.

There are ways in which blinded money is actually *more* cryptocurrency than blockchain money  by eliminating the historical record of linkability inherent in the blockchain or account-based systems, blinded tokens are inherently fungible, which supports negotiability and finality.

I'm not sure what the solution is to this article; move it en-masse to """"blockchain currency"""" or merge with bitcoin and then redirect cryptocurrency to digital cash?

Because I am pretty new to this project and was invited by the Wikipedia policy just to step in and make some edits, I would like apologize for failing to communicate with you effectively, and to clarify a couple of things:

1) I have made in the recent days some substantial contributions and modifications to the Silesia article that I felt would be valuable to the internet readers. I din't expect that some of this changes will meet with such a fierce resistance.

2) These contributions were based on my deep knowledge (in my opinion) and serious studies into the history and modern times of Silesia. My intention was to write about facts and not about opinions, and to avoid any nationalistic bias of any kind.

3) I am very seriously touched that people who introduce most of the chaos and natiolistic bias to this article are the first to accuse others of vandalism and extreme nationalism.

 20:45, 26 Oct 2003 (UTC)

 My suggestion: let's write what Silesia is now 

The Silesia article DO need some serious improvement if we want it to be the valuable and reliable resource for the internet users. The current (restored and protected) version contains so many errors that it will chase away people with basic historical knowledge, if it's not changed as soon as possible.

1) First I suggest that we write what Silesia is now (as this is most interesting to the reader), and not what is was in the past. Silesia rich history should be discussed in the history section.

2) It is unacceptable to state that Silesia lies between Odra and Vistula rivers. First look at any map will show you that Silesia lies along the Odra river.

3) Silesia lies today in Poland and Czech Republic. It is doubtful if the Goerlitz area is part of Silesia. It is a historical part of Lusatia, and was joined to the Silesian province after 1816.

4) Im my opinion we should not discuss Silesian history in the intro paragraph, but we decide to, it is unacceptable to mention only the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation

5) I do not care in what order the language-names of Silesia are mentioned, but I do insist that the Silesian version (Ślónsk, Ślunsk) is included in this list. 

6) I do insist that the various nationalities and ethnic groups living know in SIlesia, are mentioned clearly and the list should include at least: the Silesians, the Poles, the Germans, the Czechs

7) The theories about the name of the region must be clearly marked as theories and not as facts. The passages need some minor rewrite.

8) The remarks about HRE overlordship in 1146 and 1163 are simply false, no longer upheld by the German historians, and must be removed

9) Great care must be taken when dealing with Silesian history, for example the rude remarks about devastation was caused by Hussite rebellion must be rewritten using neutral words

10) The Silesia article need more sections on the People, Economy, Culture, Education, Science and Tourism.

Summary of Scylla
Scylla is supposed to be a beautiful nymph. A man called Glaucus fell in love with her. She didn’t like him and so ran away from him, effectively rejecting her. Therefore Glaucus went to a sorceress, Circe and asked for Scylla’s heart to be softened. Circe however fell in love with Glaucus who rejected her. Circe was angry at Scylla, not Glaucus and so, when Scylla was about to bathe, she poured a powerful poison into Scylla’s pool and so when Scylla bathed she turned into a horrible monster with twelve feet and six heads, all with 3 rows of teeth. Wolf heads grew from her waist and she just stood there, each one of her heads taking someone who passed her. She hated everything which came within reach and killed it.
What makes it a Good Story?
The story of the transformation of Scylla is a good story as it seems to make people realise their emotions when they hear about how Scylla was turned into an eternal being of pure evil even though she did nothing to anyone. She didn’t accept Glaucus’s love and so was turned into a supernatural being because of someone else’s jealousy of her looks.

3 Latin Words to Describe Scylla
Malus-evil
Miser- wretched/sad
Aliquid miri- something extraordinary

The Insight that the Myth Affords Into The Ancient World
This myth does not show us a lot about the ancient world as it is a myth and so does not show a representation of the real world then. It does show us however that Ovid believed strongly in superstition or that he was just an imaginative writer which is equally likely. We can get a glimpse of the colourful words which he uses to describe the dreadful transformation of Scylla.

Other
In a late Greek myth,Recorded in Eustathius' commentary on Homer and John Tzetzes, Ad Lycophron. it was said that Heracles encountered Scylla during a journey to Sicily and slew her. Her father, the sea-god Phorcys, then applied flaming torches to her body and restored her to life.  

According to John TzetzesTzetzes, Ad Lycophron 45. and Servius' commentary on the AeneidServius on Aeneid iii. 420. Scylla was a beautiful naiad who was claimed by Poseidon, but Amphitrite turned her into a monster. 

It is said that by the time Aeneas' fleet came through the strait after the fall of Troy, Scylla had been changed into a dangerous rock outcropping which still stands there to this day.

The character of Sin from John Milton's Paradise Lost is similar to Scylla. Scylla and Charybdis are actually mentioned at one point in the poem.

Horse articles 
I agree that the use of """"Footnotes"""", (or simply Notes) """"Citations"""" and """"References"""" is perfectly acceptable. However, there is no consistency in the way these terms are used and on quite a few of the FA articles the term """"Footnotes"""" is used in place of """"Citations"""" (or References) and on at least two articles the notes were labelled """"Notes"""" and the citations were labelled """"Footnotes"""". There appears to be some misunderstanding as to when and where the terms """"Notes"""" and/or """"Footnotes"""" ought to be used. If """"Citations"""" is the preferred heading for inline references, then you need to take this up with others who write about horses. My point here is specifically to eliminate the wrong usage of the term """"Footnotes"""" for sections that do not contain anything that even vaguely resembles a footnote. 

Since consistency appeared to be an issue, I changed a number of articles, simply to make them consistent. They have been changed back, and unless someone has subsequently corrected them, are no longer consistent.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 South Korea started the war 

The events now taking place in Korea broke out on June 25 as the result of a provocative attack by the troops of the South Korean authorities on the frontier areas of the Korean People's Democratic Republic. This attack was the outcome of a premeditated plan.

From time to time Syngman Rhee himself and other representatives of the South Korean authorities had blurted out the fact that the South Korean Syngman Rhee clique had such a plan.

As long ago as October 7, 1949, Syngman Rhee, boasting of success in training his army, stated outright, in an interview given to an American United Press correspondent, that the South Korean Army could capture Pyongyang in the course of three days.

On October 31, 1949, Sin Sen Mo, Defence Minister of the Syngman Rhee Government, also told newspaper correspondents that the South Korean troops were strong enough to act and take Pyongyang within a few days. Only one week before the provocative attack of the South Korean troops on the frontier areas of the Korean People's Democratic Republic, Syngman Rhee said, in a speech on June 19 in the so-called """"National Assembly"""" where Mr. Dulles, adviser to the U.S. State Department, was present: """"If we cannot protect democracy in the cold war, we shall win in a hot war.""""

It is not difficult to understand that representatives of the South Korean authorities could only make such statements because they felt that they bad American support behind them. One month before the present developments in Korea, on May 19, 1950, Mr. Johnson, chief American administrator of aid to Korea, told the American Congress House of Representatives' Appropriations Committee that 100,000 officers and men of the South Korean Army, equipped with American weapons and trained by the American Military Mission, bad completed their preparations and could begin war at any time.

It is known that only a few days before the Korean events, the United States Defence Secretary, Mr. Johnson, the Chief of the General Staff of the United States Armed Forces, General Bradley, and the State Department adviser, Mr. Dulles, arrived in Japan and had special conferences with General MacArthur, and that afterwards Mr. Dulles visited South Korea and went to frontier areas on the 38th Parallel.

Only one week before the events-on June 19-Mr. Dulles, adviser to the State Department, declared in the above-mentioned """"National Assembly"""" of South Korea that the United States was ready to give all necessary moral and material support to South Korea which was fighting against Communism.

These facts speak for themselves and need no comment. . . .

The United States Government tries to justify armed intervention against Korea by alleging that it was undertaken on the authorisation of the Security Council. The falsity of such an allegation strikes the eye.

What really happened? It is known that the United States Government had started armed intervention in Korea before the Security Council was summoned to meet on June 27, without taking into consideration what decision the Security Council might take. Thus the United States Government confronted the United Nations Organisation with a fait accompli, with a violation of peace.

The Security Council merely rubber-stamped and back-dated the resolution proposed by the United States Government, approving the aggressive actions which this Government had undertaken. . . .

The illegal resolution of June 27, adopted by the Security Council under pressure from the United States Government, shows that the Security Council is acting, not as a body which is charged with the main responsibility for the maintenance of peace, but as a tool utilised by the ruling circles of the United States for unleashing war. This resolution of the Security Council constitutes a hostile act against peace.

If the Security Council valued the cause of peace, it should have attempted to reconcile the fighting sides in Korea before it adopted such a scandalous resolution. Only the Security Council and the United Nations Secretary-General could have done this. However, they did not make such an attempt, evidently knowing that such peaceful action contradicts the aggressors' plans.

ab8856f5fb4c85af,"""In mathematics, an ordinal number, or just ordinal, is a transitive set of ordinals, or hereditarily transitive set.  That is, every element of an ordinal is transitive and its elements in turn are transitive and so on down.  The Axiom of regularity stops this recursion after finitely many steps, namely at the empty set.

The finite ordinals are 0 = {}, 1 = {0}, 2 = {0,1}, 3 = {0,1,2}, ….  This is a consequence of two remarkable facts, that every element of a finite transitive set is itself a finite transitive set (so we can drop """"ordinal"""" as a condition for membership in a finite ordinal), and only one set of each finite cardinality can be transitive, whence the finite ordinals can be identified with their cardinalities as per the foregoing enumeration.

It is evident for the finite ordinals that the successor of an ordinal α is α∪{α}.  In fact this holds for all ordinals.  We write α∪{α} as α+1.

The set of all finite ordinals is transitive and hence itself an ordinal.  It is the least infinite ordinal, and is denoted ω.  It is the canonical example of a countable set, and its cardinality is denoted .

Like the finite ordinals, ω has a successor ω+1, namely {0,1,2,…,ω}.  That in turn has a successor {0,1,2,…,ω,ω+1}, and we can continue in this way until we reach {0,1,2,…,ω,ω+1,ω+2…} = ω+ω, denoted ω·2.  Continuing faster we eventually reach ω·2+ω = ω·3.  We could consider ω·3+1, but moving yet faster we arrive at ω·4, ω·5, and eventually ω·ω, denoted ω2.  Picking up yet more speed, we arrive at ω3, ω4, … and then ωω.  Getting into high gear we speed past ωω, ωωω, ωωωω, …, to arrive at ε0, the least ordinal α satisfying α = ωα.

Throughout this entire sequence, every ordinal has been countable, that is, its cardinality has been .  However one cannot infer from this that every countable ordinal is ω.  To see this, consider listing all infinitely many even numbers first, and then continue by listing the odd numbers.  Then 1 is preceded only by even numbers, but there is no even number immediately before 1 because there is no largest even number.  So unlike the usual enumeration of the natural numbers, in which every number but 0 has a predecessor, this enumeration is structurally different, that is, it is not order isomorphic to ω.  Instead it is order isomorphic to ω+ω = ω·2, because the set of even numbers standardly ordered is order isomorphic to ω, and likewise the odd numbers.

Furthermore we have not come close to exhausting the countable ordinals: ε0+1 is countable, and so on.  To get past the countable ordinals requires a new insight.
  
Every ordinal is linearly ordered by inclusion, for example 2 < 4 because {0,1} is a subset of {0,1,2,3}.  This linear order is in fact a well-order, that is, every nonempty set of ordinals has a least element.  Hence for every predicate that is not false of all ordinals, there exists a least ordinal satisfying that predicate.  Furthermore no two ordinals are order isomorphic, and every well-ordered set is order isomorphic to some ordinal, whence the ordinals can serve to encode the order types of all well-ordered sets however large.

There exist uncountable ordinals, whence by the foregoing there exists a least uncountable ordinal, denoted ω1.  The cardinality of this ordinal is denoted , which is the next cardinal after .  There is a sequence of increasingly large ordinals as measured by their cardinality, denoted ω1, ω2, ω3, …, with corresponding cardinalities , , , ….  The cardinality of an ordinal defines a many to one association from ordinals to cardinals, with all ordinals between ωi inclusive and ωi+1 exclusive having the same cardinality .""",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Gaia (Foundation universe) 

Hey, I know this question is a bit late, but the comment you placed when you rated this article as a B class, it said it was in need of """"third part references"""".

 Wikipedia inclusion guidelines 

Hi Florenta. Whilst I recognise that you are trying to do something nice for your friend by including him in Wikipedia, please be aware that Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information. We have guidelines and policies regarding what can and cannot be included; the most important of these is that subjects must be notable. For a simple explanation, see this page.

Dan Lake does not appear to meet the criteria for notability (he has not been the subject of substantial coverage in multiple, independent, reliably published sources) and so is not a suitable subject for inclusion here.

PPPPS.  Here, for example, are Kulke and Rothermund, in their History of India 4th edition:  The various stages of the indigenous evolution of the Indus civilisation can be documented by an analysis of four sites which have been excavated in more recent years: Mehrgarh, Amari, Kalibangan, Lothal. These four sites reflect the sequence of the four important phases in the protohistory of the northwestern region of the Indian subcontinent. The sequence begins with the transition of nomadic herdsmen to settled agriculturists in eastern Baluchistan, continues with the growth of large villages in the Indus valley and the rise of towns, leads to the emergence of the great cities and, finally, ends with their decline. The first stage is exemplified by Mehrgarh in Baluchistan, the second by Amri in the southern Indus valley and the third and fourth by Kalibangan in Rajasthan and by Lothal in Gujarat.  In other words, the language changes when IVC is discussed.

Just to give an example... I've been to church until like a year ago despite I never liked catholiscism and in fact, I feared it when I was a kid.
and why did I do that? I did that because I didn't dare have a rational conversation with my parents, and what happened when I did? I was called a terrorist by my fucking father, among other things... I had to cry for days, I was ignored, made fun of and insulted... what did my mother do? she didn't force me to be a catholic like my father tryed to do, but she didn't help me either, she just seemed to agree with him, while agreeing with me when he wasn't there... just like an evil cat.
and she does just that all the time, she complains about my father's obssesive controlling personality with me and my sister, but when my father says all his bullshit to me she never says a thing, but it's different with my sister(16) because my mother supports her against my fathers crazy temperament.
my father treats me like I'm a 30 year old drug addict living off his money. he doesn't get that I'm studying a career and that(like everyone here, I dunno about other countrys) he has to pay for it... it's not like I'm not doing anything! my 'god'...
whenever I'm happy what do they do? I swear to my life that they FUCK THINGS UP FOR ME no matter what. 
and whenever I'm sad (that's most of the time arround them, because I don't dare to even joke arround with them since they are offended by anything) whenever I'm sad they come with theyr you need god in your life bullshit.
or theyr see? we are right and u r wrong bullshit...
I'm sick of this, I just wanna get a fucking job, get out of this house and lead a NORMAL LIFE where I'm not issolated from my friends  and can go out and have fun with them without being threatened with loosing the internet conection or being taken out of college...
and my sister? according to my friends who kind of know my situation... she's envious of me and that's why she treats me like shit and doesn't even respect my room like I do hers.
and can you believe I love them???? I do , and that's why I think Im looney, because this isn't possible...
I forgive them every single time! but If I want to hold on to my physical and mental health and have somwehat of a good future, I have to develop a stiff upper lip and not give a shit about them anymore.and I should even take regenge according to most of my friends! but I don't even want to!..I just wanna be left alone anf try to forget all I've been through... I just wish it was physical abusse so I could show my scars and make a point, but this way...anyone can think I'm crazy.
Maybe this is the cause of all my existential doubts, because I don't have anything to be sure of and feel confident about in my everyday life becase my family does the job of ruining everything for me.

I'm sorry for all the swear words, but I had to express how I felt somewhere, also I think I'll erase this because I don't think it's allowed at all on wikipedia, it's just that there's so much rational people here that I think I can get some good advice and I've nowhere else to turn.",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Eternity clause 

You are right about the referenced article is about not chaning the fundamental principles of democracy. And this is why I have a BIG problem with Lone boatman. He does not want the word """"democracy"""". He then took revenge by changing the entire article into a catch all (international page in which he redefines 'eternity clause' as a """"term"""" used internationally instead of the colloquial description specific to Article 79 paragraph (3) of the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany. He added the additional data at the top of the page only in an act of revenge and to cover up the 'eternity clause' article. And again he focused on the word """"constition"""" at the top of his changes. And when I told him he had wrongfully duplicated the """"entrenched clause"""" and again was wrongfully pushing the word """"constitution"""" (which Germany does not have), he then added """"Basic Law"""" to his change. Then several editors suddently (for the first time) showed up and one of them deleted the entire 'eternity clause' article, leaving only what Lone boatman had put in. Wikipedia is apparently no place to safeguard an article, even a properly referenced article, which it was. And it was not a personal essay on a statue, but a very important contribution regarding democracy in Germany based on the law.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

At some point this began to happen.  It is incredibly offensive.  In fact, to me, it is much more offensive than if someone called me a cunt.  The first time, I assumed it was an isolated incident, but then it happened again... and again... and again.  At least 10 times, and perhaps 20 times or more, my edits have been reverted, often with no explanation, and sometimes with accusations of vandalism.  It's been many months since the first time.  And whether you take a polite tone, or you just mouth off at everyone, the end result is exactly the same.  I have seen probably three or maybe four editors, yourself included, who have taken what I thought was the obvious view that you shouldn't arbitrarily revert IP edits, and I have seen at least ten times as many editors who revert arbitrarily, and plenty who invent post-hoc justifications for their actions.

With all the fanfare, it is perfect timing for the Original Patent Troll to make his comeback in the recent re-release of The Patents Video.

In 1994, the Patent Troll made his first appearance in The Patents Video.  At its first release, The Patents Video was purchased by hundreds of corporations, universities, governmental entities and law firms.  In The Patents Video, an unsuspecting victim is surprised by the Original Patent Troll who strategically positioned himself to collect patent licensing revenue.

Using dramatic vignettes, entertaining scenarios, humor and expert advice, The Patents Video explains the most commonly misunderstood concepts and the most critical information about patents.  The Patents Video was designed to visually make key messages memorable.  Topics include intellectual property (IP) law basics, domestic and foreign patent bar dates, patenting of ideas, and claim language with respect to patent infringement.  

Engineers, scientists, marketers, managers, executives and corporate attorneys have a lesson in Bar Dates that no one forgets when they watch The Patents Video.   Og, a caveman in a dream, has invented the wheel.  Og and Thak push the wheel through downtown – all in public view.  The Patents Video, an entertaining educational tool, explains how and why Og and Thak have lost their foreign patent filing rights and explains, in detail, how to avoid triggering U.S. and foreign patent Bar Dates.

When I wrote """"75(note 15)"""" above, I should have written """"75([superscript:]??"""" looks like """"25"""" or """"2.5"""" in GBooks' representation. When I looked at this entry on p. 3-366 before, it looked like """"15"""". Also, on """"Explanation of Table"""" p. 3-2, I read
""""The data in the table have many sources, including both the primary literature and evaluated compilations.  The Handbook of Data on Organic Compounds, Third edition (Ref. 7) and the Combined Chemical Dictionary (Ref. 8) were important sources. Other useful sources of physical property data on organic compounds are listed in Refs. 9-19.  The values in the table for the normal boiling point and the melting point that are accompanied with uncertainties (in parenthesis) have been critically evaluated using the NIST ThermoData Engine (TDE, Ref. 20), designed to implement the dynamic data evaluation concept (Refs. 21-24).  This concept requires large electronic databases capable of storing essentially all relevant data known to date with detailed descriptions of metadata and uncertainties.  The combination of these electronic databases with expert-system software, designed to automatically generate recommended property values based on available experimental and predicted data, leads to the ability to produce critically evaluated data dynamically, 'to order.' The uncertainties listed are combined expanded uncertainties (level of confidence, approximately 95 %) representing the most comprehensive measure of the overall data reliability (Refs, 25-28).""""
So this suggests that some temperature values in the table are automatically derived but as I say, the """"25"""" or """"2.5"""" is a raised, reduced-sized font, not parenthesized. So the superscript may well refer to alternate sample pressure - I can't find whatever it references. I apologize if this dwells on this source too much; I think the consensus here that the bp is significantly higher than 75'C is dispositive.

 Issue on images still unresolved 

Slim, I'm copying this message and my reply to your page for your notice.

I appreciate your inputs in Image talk:Monkey3.jpg and I agree once in a while I might sound rude (purely unintentional, since I put facts blantly). But SlimVirgin is abusing his admin power to overrule anyone.

Slim is not a """"he"""". Given that she named herself after a Javanese princess, perhaps you could take the hint and note that she's a woman. Also, I don't think you were simply blunt. I think you were rude to Slim. I recognise it's a fine line but given that I've mentioned it to you, perhaps you'll take more care to stay on the right side of it?

She has suggested in an email to me, that she is in talks with another editor. Now, I don't know who this other editor and i certainly don't like this secrecy. Instead of having a discussion on this, she wants to finish the matter begind closed doors. She could've atleast told me who this reputed editor was to let me have a word with him/her.

Perhaps she is seeking guidance on how she should approach you and wants that to be untainted by your input. I think that would be reasonable. I have a high regard for Slim and I don't think she would have a nefarious purpose in speaking to a third party.

Inso far as the images are concerned, I had stated to her a couple of images on one issue (animal rights) is ok, but she insists she needs to showcase the entire album provided by PETA and its assocites.

So you have a dispute. You need to recognise that you are not necessarily right! You disagree about how many images are necessary. I feel that you have to allow that your disagreement might be fuelled by your political differences as much as how you interpret the image policy.

This should could easily achieve by providing an external link to the images provided by a controversial organization.

The BUAV is not a """"controversial organisation"""". It is a highly respected body, whose voice is listened to in all circles of British society. A viewpoint doesn't become """"controversial"""" just because you don't share it.

Wikipedia is supposed to be neutral and not have extreme viewpoints - 

But you expect it to reflect your viewpoint.

thus I requested her to limit her fair use policy in this regard to 2-3 images which can be used across similar articles. this she refuses.

I don't see how it is any fairer to use one, two or ten images in this instance. While I agree that Slim could have taken more care to provide a rationale for using the images, I simply don't feel that your argument about how many she should have used has much weight. One factor in deciding fair use is how much of a thing you use, that's true, but it's only one factor, and obviously, each picture is a separate case to be considered as well as part of a whole.

As far as the other images, some are on personalities she claims have """"agreed"""" to use their photos here. Unless she gets a written consent and a permission how can I believe.

First of all, you can believe Slim because you assume good faith. Perhaps you're not aware of that policy. Yes, you can ask Slim to provide evidence of that, but your assumption should be that she has in fact acquired that agreement. Harassing another editor to provide evidence to your satisfaction and insisting you won't believe them until they have do not show an assumption of good faith.

Once I pointed out that {permission} photos would be deleted anyway, she backed off and argued that it be kept on the grounds of fair use asking me to trust her.

Yes, okay. Trust her AND ask for proof.

Both of us are editing in good faith, but one of us has power and a circle of friends to back her while the other (me) relies on the hope that ppl. like you will help me out in this.

I'd urge you to rely on the issues rather than the personalities. Yes, Slim does have powerful friends, who will back her regardless, but you should still do your best to make it about the issue in question and not about her.

 My position on the two Irelands, using Arbcom and admin abuse 

I give my views on the two Irelands in the paragraphs below, but I will begin with what I feel is most serious.

I've had a look back, and IMO, there is one thing in particular I that is pressing for Wikipedia's future here:

The admin User:Deacon of Pndapetzim must have his adminship fully questioned in the correct place. No one has a chance on Wikipedia when an admin acts (and wheel wars) like he has done – and I believe he has overstepped the line, and made a difficult but legal situation into a nightmare situation for everyone. I warned him of the mayhem that would be caused if Ireland was simply reverted into being a cultural all-island article, but he ignored me. This edit note (and selective deletion) is an example of the kind of intellectual demeaning by admin that lead to me losing my own temper. You cannot treat adults like children. It shows feelings of superiority in being an admin - which must not be condoned. Aside from his attitude, the way he reversed admin Tariqabjotu's Ireland Move, citing a very small hand-picked selection of admin who share his personal position on this - to his own personal wishes, was totally unacceptable. Where were all the other admin I saw who spoke up? For reasons I give after after I get the following paragraph off my chest, he completely shattered Wikipedia for me when he did that, and his reasoning for doing it showed it to be nothing other than an act of hypocrisy, as well as self interest. Arbitration are not there to be interested themselves (by their own admission) - they are only there to be there, and there is nowhere else now to to go. It has all been completely messed up now – so Arbcom has to be pulled in.

I regret that I am leaving Wikipedia with the worse kind of people in my mind, in a place that is actually full of fantastic unacknowledged philanthropy. I won't go the way of saying what I (100%, in all good faith, IMHO, genuinely, without doubt etc, etc) honestly think this is comparable to - people call it a 'Godwin', a commonly-used term which belittles the technical purity of the very example - an early internet 'battle' won by some clever person, for sure. But you have to think beyond the cliche. The talk-page admin 'cop out' over any car crash, is normally to pretend this place is just a pastime, but WIkipedia is a little more important than that - no? And conspiracy theorising - don't point that one at me – it us such an ugly slur. Who needs those, when you give ‘’individuals’’ so much power? People group - they always do. The only 'conspiracy' could be within wondering why Wikipedia has to be structured in this way. It's a Sunday drive, and includes the world - but anything difficult like this? The structure simply breaks down. So do some people want a loose ship? A negative answer would have little to do with the Irelands anyway.

Two wrongs don't make a right, and equally bad is a wrong made after a right. Now how was Deacon right? The first move to Ireland disam/(state)/(island) was rational and sound 'policy-over-polling', the reversal (in the horrendous way it was done) was wrong in every possible way. Those who were interested in doing so, simply needed to re-debate it from where it was (perhaps prove it in a global poll?). But why should I do even more work towards facilitating that? I have given hundreds of hours of my life to this already. And where now were those originally opposing? A number of them were addressing new content. The carefully avoided truth is that a global poll (so hard to bring about – I know, as I’ve tried) would simply bring in changes. I gave my time editing the changes I saw before me, and my work has been cynically thrown down the drain. And look at the edit frenzy now! Too few admin actually give a shit when people's time is wasted. The reversal of tariqabjotus's move has vindicated every troll, SPA, contentious editor, sock-maker and IP-abuser watching, who in this Ireland problem, are the worker-minions of the wholly-debilitating 'dual Irish country' """"solution"""".

Ireland isn't Palestine, it isn't the People's Republic of China, it's just a country commonly called 'Ireland' on an island which has two states on it (one with a sea divide) - called Ireland - and Wikipedia, despite the efforts of so many, hasn't been allowed to properly address and present that undeniable fact. The Irish country now has two time-sharing homes again - two mixed-up modern-day country articles, one of them subsuming part of a separate country altogether - simply because it shares the island. Silly non-policy arguments about where to put historical 'Ireland's aside, there has always been an Irish nation (covering all or most",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Solar intensity due to proximity  
Ratio between Aphelion and Perihelion: Axial tilt comparison still needed

Request confirmation of math

There is some effect of the distance between the sun and the earth on the radiant energy reaching the earth. There is some measure of heating northern latitudes up in their winter, up to a maximum at Jan 3, and heating southern latitudes up in their summer. Thus, the winters in northern latitudes (all other variables such as warming by ocean currents, etc, removed from consideration), are relatively more mild, and the summers in southern latitudes (variables removed), relatively more extreme. However, the ratio of the aphelion (furthest distance) to the perihelion (nearest) is only 1.033988391 . So, a difference of 3.4%.

Then to calculate what that does to the total radiant energy: Inverse-square law says, """"the radiation passing through any unit area is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the point source"""" Received light quadruples as the distance halves.

So 

E sun energy stays the same so is 1, solving for intensity I, d is distance, using perihelion distance as 1, d (aphelion) = 1.033988391 and d2 = 1.069131994.

Multiply both sides of the equation by 1.069131994, so that I is both multiplied and divided by the same number; this cancels out, and E is now 1.069131994. E is now equal to I, as I is no longer divided by anything. I =  1.069131994.

1.069 times (aphelion intensity) = perihelion intensity. 

1 / 1.069131994 = 0.935338204, 

.935 times (perihelion intensity) = aphelion intensity.

Axial tilt total radiant energy and/or comparison with the above remains to be found

 Ataturk and Kurds 

AW, the article is about Ataturks life in a factual historical context. It is about the things he had done in his life. Not about what Kurds think of him.

Let's take Coca-Cola for example, a completely benign subject. If someone said """"Pepsi lover's critique Coke for being too acidic"""" (source:Pepsi lovers magazine)"""" would you consider that part of the history of Coke or part of the history of Pepsi lovers? It certainly is an opinion, that could only be the history of a Pepsi lover because Coke has nothing to with their taste or aspirations of how a cola should be. (sorry for the silly analogy but you get the point I hope). Furthermore, this maybe a fact (it's a fact that someone had this critique of coke), but it's not an historical event, a historical fact, nor is it NPOV. 

Now if you apply this to Kurdish """"criticizms"""", then you would get the same outcome. It's all a matter of taste. And there a millions critiques of Ataturks out there, some being offensive to Kurds. Shall we include those as well?

Not to mention, which Kurds criticized? When did they do this? How many are there? What are their credentials? So you also have a credibility problem here.

Moreover, your sources can't possibly speak for all Kurds. I would be surprised if you could dispute that FACT.

According to USA today, they sold most of their albums after Joey's death in 2001. To date, Ramones CDs with Somebody Put Something In My Drink have sold more than 1.3 million copies. Smash You was released as the title track to Loud Fast Ramones. 

e)Richie Ramone did not sue his """"dead band mates"""". He sued the Estate of Johnny Ramone as well as Ramones Productions. He did not sue the Estate of Joey Ramone, nor the Estate of Dee Dee Ramone, nor has he sued the wives and relatives of Joey Ramone and Dee Dee Ramone. Source is the lawsuit. He did not sue Joey's brother Mickey Leigh, Dee Dee's wife Barbara, nor Joey's truly execptional mother Charlotte Lesher. 

First Media Lawyer says the band continued to be successful, and then it's that they have no money. Fact is, Ramones productions is a very lucrative business. Again, USA Today reported in 2002 that the band sold millions of units since Joey Ramone's death. That is according to Soundscan. Paper Magazine and others have reported on the big business of marketing Ramones since the sad passing of Joey Ramone. Media Lawyer's statement that the Ramones are in """"hardship"""" is not sourced. 

Request: Please remove what we believe is libelous incorrect TALK comment by Media Lawyer, unless Media Lawyer can produce reliable sources. At the very least, none of it is sourced.

Thank you.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

A while ago, I made some edits that Johntex didn't like, and so instead of trying to resolve it on the article discussion page, he posted a wildly dishonest complaint in which he resorted to outright lying about me to get me blocked from editing the page for a month (his initial goal being to get me completely banned). I continued to be outraged at his behavior and the fact that he remains completely unpunished for his behavior, and posted complaints on his talk page. Once again, rather than trying to resolve it, he went here to lie about me in his continued belief that anyone who annoys him should be banned. And yet again, he posted numerous lies:

5 days ago, with no provocation whatsoever, Heqwm made a personal attack against me on my talk page. As explained above, the claim that there was no provocation whatsoever is an outright lie.

I have never posted lies about him. Another lie.

I left him a message on his talk page asking him to provide diffs to back up his allegations. He declined to do so. Another lie. I pointed out that I had provided him with the diffs over and OVER again, and each time he simply lied and said that they don't say what he said they clearly said.

Wizardman warned Heqwm that this was a personal attack. Heqwm repeated his personal attack on his own talk page. I removed the """"anti-barnstar"""" and personal attack from my talk page, but Heqwm re-added it. I discussed the charge on my talk page. And Johntes's recounting is dishonest, as it implies that my reposting the attack happened after Wizardman's warning, when in fact it happened before.

Heqwm has been at this mischief for a long time. Mischief? Insisting that liars be punished is """"miscief""""? What kind of world do we live in?

He has been warned by other users as well, and has been placed on a form of community probation. Yes, on the basis of the very lies that are the issue here.

I don't think I have any any interaction with him since then, so I can only assume he is still upset about being put on probation, or about the related mediation case which he filed and then abandoned. Abandoned after several weeks went by without any mediator stepping forward (and after Johntex engaged in behavior in blatant violation of WP:CIVIL and WP:AGF).

His talk page history is littered with controversy and conflict with many other editors on many topics. After several years, with me not deleting anything, there are now several instances of people disagreeing with me. And...?

I ask whether Heqwm has exhausted the community's patience? I ask whether this is not a clear threat and an instance of Johntex's bullying.

To top it off, another admin came along and blocked me only a few hours after Johtex's request, meaning that I had no opportunity to address the charges.

-

Jonhtex responded """"I request that Heqwm again be blocked for posting unsubstantiated personal attacks where he accuses me of lying.""""  So... Johntex is allowed to attack me on ANI, but if I respond to his charges, I should be blocked?  Yet another example of his bullying.  As for """"undsubstantiated, I have diffs and screenshots showing quite clearly that Johntex lied.

I believe that the Phyllis Schlafly article falsely maligns Schlafly by misinterpreting a NY Times book review.

 The article implies that Schlafly opposed Nixon over """"segregation and discrimination"""",
while the source only says that she was with conservatives who were going to oppose whatever Rockefeller proposed.
 The article relies on a Jewish NY Times columnist raising a Jewish issue,
without mentioning that the columnist is a Jew who writes about Jewish issues, and that no one else raises this Jewish issue.
 The article implies that Schlafly used Jewish code words, while the source
does not explicitly say so. All the source really says is that her opinion is that
the biography should have commented on the matter further.

 Hi . Wikipedia has a strict policy on how we write about living people. Wikipedia is one of the top 5 websites on the planet—if someone types anything in Google, Wikipedia will almost certainly be on the first page of results if we have an article about it. As a result, we have to pay special attention to living people. Anything we write about them can actually harm them in real life if it isn't backed up by high-quality reliable sources. In other words, we need to get the article right. And one important policy we have is that any poorly sourced negative information about living people should be removed. Next time, you need to back up your content with reliable sources—see Wikipedia:Citing sources and Wikipedia:Referencing for beginners for how to do this.

b2e533c86bc47f80,"""IN RESPONSE TO THE GENETICS OF KURDS AND JEWS==

I would like to point something out. There are genetic similarities between certain Jewish groups and Iranian peoples that is because those people are Iranian Jews, either Tats, or Persian Jews or Kurdish Jews. Jewish people are not an ethnic group they are a faith or religious group. There are Negroid Jews from Africa and Dravidian Jews from southern India. One of the largest populations to have Jews is that of the Iranian peoples. In fact the state of Iran has the second largest Jewish population in the Middle East after Israel. The similarity of these people, Jews and Kurds in particular is due to shared Iranian genes among a few other minor ones. There is an article about Kurdish Jews and Persian Jews. It is called the """"Children of Queen Ester."""" Ester was the Empress of Queen of Iran and wife of Emperor Xerxes who fought the Athenians and Spartans in what classical scholars refer to as the Persian Wars. A large portion of Israelis are Iranian Jews like Israel's head of state, Moshe Katsav http://www.knesset.gov.il/president/epres_page.htm who is from Yazd, Iran and the current Israeli defence minister. 

The genetic similarities that are greatest between Kurds and Jews are with the group of Jews that are Iranian or also what is termed 'Iranic' origin such as Persian Jews and Kurdish Jews or Tats. One will find that Jews that are from Arabic countries are very similar to Arabs and that Jews from Europe are very similar genetically to the Europeans. 

Mind you there is in most Jews a hint or trace of that unique Hebrew gene of their Semitic ancestors, but it is not the dominant genetic make up. The genes of the nations the Jews settled in are what are dominant in their genetic makeup. A Russian Jew is ethnically a Russian while an Iranian Jew is ethnically an Iranian. European Jews are in fact not Semitic, as opposed to Arab Jews who are Semitic. Semitic peoples are tanned and dark haired people, while many European Jews are fair and resemble the native European population. I hope you follow.

Genetically and hereditarily the closes people to the Kurds are the Lur and   Bakhtari, which are both Iranian peoples, followed by the Persians. 

The article that is basically claiming that Kurds are closer to Jewish populations than Iranians is incoherent and should be deleted because it is taken out of context and is from a non-primary and constricted source that has been widely disagreed with by the scientific community.

You ignored repeated lower case attempts to engage you in dialog, asking you clearly, """"allow discussion to continue.""""

Wikipedia:LGBT notice board
This explains a lot of the experience I've had in LGBT articles, this is used as a recruitment point to spread LGBT based propaganda.  They are not the slightest bit interested in POV and get offended when you delete clearly POV and unsubstantiated, dubious content.  They suggest you basically write the article from scratch for them since it's crap, because to them it's better to keep in totally incorrect propaganda then have a small article.

They insist on making a million different articles covering every topic, sub-topic and sub-sub-topic on everything related to LGBT stuff (notice the abundance of """"Homosexuality and"""" type articles), there is TONS of redundant information.

Professor Simon Wessely and claims of harassment

PERMISSION TO REPOST

Below is a series of correspondence I have recently had with Professor Peter McGuffin, Dean of Psychiatry at the Institute of Psychiatry, King's College, London, and John Williams, Interim Head of HR , at the Institute of Psychiatry, King's College, London.

I have transcribed the correspondence by both, but have the original documents in my possession.

The contents of this correspondence are self-explanatory.

I am publishing this correspondence for two reasons:

1. I consider that I have been defamed, and seek to protect my good name and reputation against defamatory attacks of this nature.

2. This correspondence, sadly, provides merely one example of an increasingly unpleasant and worrying phenomenon. I have observed, over the years, a growing tendency, by some, to make grossly ad hominem attacks on ME/CFS advocates and the community at large. These are logically indefensible, and morally and intellectually unsound: and have had the effect of preventing reasonable, legitimate voices of criticism being acknowledged within the discourse of ME/CFS politics, with adverse consequences for sufferers. This is a phenomenon which I will return to over the coming months.

Angela Kennedy

1. Letter from Angela Kennedy to Peter McGuffin:

1st October 2007

Dear Professor McGuffin,

I am writing to you about a serious matter of defamation which potentially involves a member of your department, Professor Simon Wessely.

I am an advocate for my daughter, a young woman seriously ill and severely disabled by her illness, who was diagnosed with ME/CFS. I also politically advocate for the community at large. I am also a known critic of the ‘psychiatric paradigm’ of ME/CFS, and I undertake this from an academic perspective (I appreciate the above term might be contested, but that is not the issue at hand).

I am currently working towards publication on this issue, having been engaged in academic research for some years. I have a social science background and am an Associate Lecturer with the Open University (although the work I am undertaking in this field is not connected to this institution).

I therefore do have a reputation that might be damaged by libellous, defamatory comments.

In recent weeks, various editors of the Wikipedia online encyclopaedia have expressed an intention to publish claims that Professor Wessely has ‘retired’ from ‘CFS’ research because of ‘harassment’ by certain people within the ME/CFS patient community. The basis for these claims is the Gibson Report, an unofficial, unsourced, un-referenced document, which has been criticised for key inaccuracies, and inflammatory, inaccurate language about the patient community and its advocates.

I, with other advocates, have endeavoured to provide reasons and evidence as to why the Gibson Report is not a reliable source, and why claims of ‘harassment’ are, certainly at present, unsubstantiated and unsafe to the point they should not be published on Wikipedia. One advocate has attempted to clarify, by contacting MP Ian Gibson himself, the source of the comment, within the report itself, that Professor Wessely has retired from “CFS” research, and the claim that this was """"possibly due to extreme harassment"""" [my italics] present within the report. Ian Gibson’s researcher is following this up.

This is an extremely important issue. I, like many in the community, would condemn harassment of academics (particularly harassment as defined in criminal law), particularly as I am myself an academic, and because I have been subjected to criminal harassment before, which I have reported to the police. However, there is also a problem around the use of the term ‘harassment‘: ME/CFS sufferers and their advocates have for many years been subject to inaccurate ad hominem attacks on their motives for protesting the psychiatric paradigm. Inaccurate descriptions of legitimate critique as ‘personal attack’, or ‘abuse’, or terms actually associated with criminal ‘harassment’ are all too common, to the detriment of a patient community with valid concerns.

On September 26th, and 27th, 2007, a member of the Wikipedia online encyclopaedia posted a long attack on myself and others, which included the comments below, on their ‘Admin Notice board’, which were grossly misrepresentative of my work, and which",0,0,0,0,0,0

Jayjg, is there any edit to this article you would accept? What are your objections to clarifying ethnic vs. religious definitions of """"Jews""""? The article is currently confusing as to which is which, and it would help to clarify that JfJ means ethnic Jews. I think in the case Mackan points out, """"many"""" is appropriately used-many Jewish groups do see JfJ that way, but certainly not all (I would imagine there are plenty of Jewish groups without any official position on JfJ.) Also, most religions are rather fluid and change over time, and there is often debate over interpretation. It is, therefore, not quite so easy to state religious principles as fact (Jews don't believe in Jesus as Messiah? What about Messianic Judaism?) Of course, religious faith also tends to be given over to a lot of dogmatism (""""my way is the correct one"""" type of thinking), so sometimes it's difficult to see debates to that as valid. WP:WEASEL does not object to ever using """"many"""" or """"most"""" or the like as qualifiers, it advocates against it only in the absence of sourcing. What we have here is a lot of sourcing, which does not, however, show that all Jews object to JfJ (as I explained above, that would be effectively impossible). It does, of course, show that """"many"""" do (I wouldn't even object to """"almost all"""" or """"most""""), but in order to preserve the plausibility requirement of WP:NPOV (JfJ's assertion that it is Jewish must be treated as plausible), it is impossible that all Jewish organizations disagree-as JfJ doesn't!

Entry for Joliet Correctional Center.

""""Jake is irritated at being picked up by his brother Elwood in a battered former Mt. Prospect, Illinois police car, instead of the Cadillac The Blues Brothers used to own.""""

It's unclear here, however the Caddy Jake refers to may be Murph and the Magictones' pink vehicle first seen in the """"Howard Johnson's"""" scene where Jake and Elwood phone Maury Sline and are blasted the flame-throwing mystery woman. 

The Blues Brothers visit their childhood home, a Roman Catholic orphanage, Saint Helen-of-the-Blessed-Shroud Orphanage. From Sister Mary Stigmata (Kathleen Freeman), The Blues Brothers learn that a property tax lien on the orphanage property will be foreclosed upon unless five thousand dollars in property taxes is remitted on its behalf to the county (the associated church has elected instead to sell the building to the Board of Education rather than pay the tax assessment).

Part of the film's humour is the actual name of the orphanage. Credit to Kathleen Freeman. People erroneously thing charities and churches are completely tax-exempt; however the exemption most notably only extends to Federal income taxes. The property tax bill would probably have remained an unforeclosed lien had the church not decided to sell voluntarily to the Board of Education.

""""At the advice of their childhood mentor, Curtis (Cab Calloway), The Blues Brothers attend an evangelical church service at Triple Rock Baptist Church, led by the Reverend Cleophus James (James Brown), where Jake has an epiphany: The Blues Brothers can legitimately raise the funds by re-forming their rhythm and blues band, The Blues Brothers’ Show Band and Revue.""""

Credit to Cab Calloway and James Brown.
  
""""As The Blues Brothers drive past a doughnut shop and Nelson Funeral Home in the Bluesmobile, Elwood’s driving alerts two Illinois State Police troopers, Trooper Daniel (Armand Cerami) and Trooper Mount (Steven Williams), who, after pursuing The Blues Brothers into a quiet, secluded residential area, learn from their in-car SCMODS (State-County-Municipal Offender Data System) computer terminal of Elwood’s suspended driver's license. When Trooper Daniel and Trooper Mount attempt to place Elwood under arrest, Elwood speeds off, escaping by driving and crashing through, with the Illinois State Troopers in pursuit, the Dixie Square Mall.""""

Entry for Bluesmobile; since location in Chicago and Illinois is obviously a major plot element, reference that the particular law-enforcement agency here is the ISP; SCMODS article already exists, with explanation of the meaning, in this context; article exists for Dixie Square Mall. 

""""After parking the Bluesmobile in an alley-end compartment next to a high-voltage transformer (hence the Bluesmobile’s remarkable magical abilities) and arriving at Elwood’s home, a hotel for transients, The Blues Brothers are mysteriously unharmed from a bazooka attack launched by a mystery woman (Carrie Fisher).""""

Credit cast member Carrie Fisher; this scene is cut from many televised versions, DVD featurette commentary explains that Canadian actor Aykroyd felt this scene explained the Bluesmobile's magical abilities, yet director Landis felt this was not transparent.

""""The next morning, just as the Illinois State Troopers who attempted to arrest Elwood the previous evening, with the help of Parole officer Burton Mercer (John Candy) as to the true address of “the elegant abode of one Elwood Blues” (because Elwood had ‘falsified his renewal’ and ‘put down ten sixty West Addison’, the street address of Wrigley Field) attempt to serve an arrest warrant at Elwood’s tiny room. The mystery woman detonates a bomb that demolishes the building, which inadvertently saves The Blue Brothers from another attempted arrest.""""

Candy's character was important because he assisted in locating Elwood's abode; the 'Wrigley Field bit' is important plot-element humor.

""""Elwood proceeds to his “straight job”, on the assembly line at an aerosol-can manufacturer, takes several cans from the line and places them in his briefcase, and visits the plant manager, quitting his job, citing a decision to become a priest (curiously, Elwood’s supervisor’s office is adorned with a U.S. flag and an Illinois state flag, suggesting that the aerosol-can manufacturer in an enterprise owned by the government of the State of Illinois—or else simply that Elwood’s supervisor thought it would be cool to adorn his office with",0,0,0,0,0,0

In section C6.1 Kozima uses the phrase """"cold fusion phenomenon (CFP)"""". In that context I equate """"cold fusion phenomenon (CFP)"""" with nuclear transmutation. However, perhaps it would be better to summarize Kozima as follows:
Hideo Kozima, professor emeritus of physics at Shizuoka University, asserts that an atomic analysis of microspheres which had been used in a Patterson Power Cell shows that the microspheres contain atoms that are the """"products of cold fusion phenomenon (CFP)"""".
Kozima uses his """"TNCF model"""" to explain the presence of the """"new"""" atoms but it is probably not necessary to include a reference to that hypothesis.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Main points AGAINST this article (RfC)
Information that shows irregularities, tendentious editing, vandalism and POV on this article should written here:
I will start from what looks to be the main problem. 
Albanian nationalism refers to nationalism among Albanians. It should not necessarily show only claims made by certain circles as is done in this article. So the first sentence of the article: Albanian nationalism (also known as Albanianism[1][2][3][4][5] or Pan-Albanianism[6][7]) refers to nationalist Albanian ideologies and theories that were cemented during Communist Albania (1945-1991), its continuation into modern Albania, as well as its proliferation in Kosovo is a POV. Albanian nationalism does not refer only to ideologies and theories that were cemented during Communist Albania... it refers also to Albanian national uprising and Renaissance and Albanian national pride. 
Kosovo is a disputed matter and to say: """"The struggle for the liberation of Kosovo from Serb rule became the struggle for the recovery of the ancient land of'the Dardanians and thus a re-creation of their ancient kingdom"""" is a POV. Here are references that beg to differ One, Two, Three and Four. For more read Kosovo.

Let's start from these two issues! —

For example, there is a greater demand for dialysis, Xigirs, colonoscopies, and new technologies like HeartMate than what is being supplied to these patients.  Instead of spending more money to meet the demand, demand is artificially lowered through denial of treatment or waiting times.  This is rationing in the normal sense of the term.

Ethnic Violence
I think the following paragraph should be removed from the article -

It has been suggested that the random violence was a delayed response to crime perpetrated by other middle easterners, such as gang rapes that occured in 2000 and 2002.

My main problem with it is that the claim being put forward is totally unsourced and unsupported. Yes, whoever put it in has provided an article from the Australian as a source. However, if you actually read this article, it doesn't say anything of the sort about the violence being some kind of delayed response to events in 2000 and 2002. In fact, it only mentions rape once. Here is the relevant section of the article -

In an article on this page nearly two years ago (""""Don't turn a blind eye to terror in our midst,"""" January 12, 2004), I argued that the increasing frequency of racially motivated attacks on young Australian men and women - including murders, gang rapes and serious assaults by young men of Lebanese Muslim descent - would rise dramatically throughout Australia. These problems remain widespread and have been documented in the ensuing two years.

Treatise on the True Temple of the Buddha, a ruling of time and space by the Sovereign.
To understand the Temple of True Buddhism, you must first understand time and space.

With that, Taiseki-Ji could be the altar of True Buddhism, or is Japan the altar and Taiseki Ji its centre. Or is the world we live on its Altar or this solar system or Galaxy...
Regardless of how you look at it.

As Taiseki Ji as the altar, Tokyo is the Incenser and volcano's its candles with the forest's as its evergreens. The sea then is the water offering.
As Japan as its altar, LA could be seen as its insencer, and volcano's its candles and the oceans and its sea's the water offering, and the forests of the world are its evergreens.
As the world as its altar, the sun as its candles and this solar system its offerings of water and insence.
As the Solar system as its altar, the galaxy its offerings.
As this galaxy as its altar, then the universe is its offerings to the DAI GOHONZON.

With that, the true temple of the BUDDHA has been created for a very long time, and its core which is the Dai Gohonzon is blessed.

Fact: The majority of soldiers serving in the Rhodesian Army at the time of the bush war were black.

Fact: ZIPRA/ZANLA """"forces"""" deployed within Rhodesia preferred to not engage the Rhodesian armed forces, and this was also not their role, as operating in small groups of up to 20 men, without any form of air support, they could not take on the security on anything approaching equal terms.

When the book starts talking about the Vietnamese mind, its almost embarrasing to read it. Yes, it won awards when it was published. But its a very flawed book. For example, the basis of your claim that only 800 people died in the anti-landlord campaign is that her North Vietnamese/NLF friends told the author so. By contrast, Stanley Karnow writing in 1983, was writing in a less hysterical political climate and had access to more material than was available in 1972.

Well, 4twenty42o, I certainly don't put on any show here, but if you find it amusing, please have a laugh. Certainly I don't see any fun in it whatsoever. I sure hope that NeilN would take another approach and not jump the gun as he certainly did this time. Also, yes, I am frustrated, and I most certainly have the best reason in the world for that. Mario Roering is not only lying, violating my copyright, slandering, posting defamation etc. here on Wikipedia harming Genseiryu and myself etc. but he does so with dedicated pages in my name on his own homepage and other sites on the Internet. Keeping up with Mario Roering and posting complaints and requests for removal of content on sites such as YouTube, free webhosting etc. is a full time job. Mario Roering has absolutely no just cause for doing what he does, and his involvement here at Wikipedia is no different from his exploiting every other possible way on the Internet to slander me. On the contrary. That is why I do not need anymore crap from anyone, and perhaps I do tend to sort people a little too fast, even though their actions may not have been ill intended, but perhaps the last situation illustrates quite well exactly why I tend to do that? Another good example is when both Mario Roering and I were blocked a few weeks back, Mario Roering was unblocked just an instant later, but I was not, even though we posted the exact same reasons for requesting the unblock. Ever since 2005, when all this started, Mario Roering's candy-talking, deceits and lies have won him favors here on Wikipedia from the admins and others. The last action from NeilN would in my best opinion constitute yet another one such favor. I have never ever postulated, that these favors were done or initiated on purpose, but I have, and I still do claim, that lack of interest for fairness, facts and true intentions, makes this kind of manipulation by Mario Roering possible. And it should not be possible. EVERYONE should be equal to rules and regulations, but for Mario Roering, on mcuh more than one occasion, that has indeed not been the case. Mario Roering has been able to continue his deceitful and ill intended ways on Wikipedia for almost 5 years now. When will it ever stop? As long as it is this easy for Mario Roering to manipulate everyone he wants to, I cannot see the end of it. Even though I still believe that Mario Roering was using NeilN, and that NeilN did indeed jump the gun here siding with one party, instead of issuing equal consequences for both, I will let this one go and """"reset"""" the system.

I do not believe this event, which appears to be isolated to the campus only, is notable. The article over is improving, but the article still has a fair amount of POV... and it has improved since being nominated for GAR.

'What happened to the imperial soldiers after the cataclysm remains a mistery, but it is assumed that most of them pledged allegience to Kefka and decided to become his honorguards and worshipers for the sake of their own survival and would otherwise be killed.'

Why exactly is it 'assumed' that most Imperial soldiers pledged allegiance to Kefka, and by whom is this assumed? Wouldn't make more sense to assume that most Imperial soldiers simply stopped soldiering and moved on with their lives after the Empire was wiped off the face of the world?

Granted, the player will encounter a variation of prototype MagiTek armor in Kefka's tower, but it seems just as likely that these are prototypes that Kefka's own minions scavanged from the remains of the MagiTek Factory, or even perhaps these units belong to a small faction of Imperial fanatics trying to infiltrate the Tower and overthrow Kefka themselves.

 You should wait for others to write an article about subjects in which you are personally involved, as you did at Japan Focus. This applies to articles about you, your achievements, your business, your publications, your website, your relatives, and any other possible conflict of interest. 

Creating an article about yourself is strongly discouraged. If you create such an article, it might be listed on articles for deletion. Deletion is not certain, but many feel strongly that you should not start articles about yourself. This is because independent creation encourages independent validation of both significance and verifiability. All edits to articles must conform to Wikipedia:No original research, Wikipedia:Neutral point of view, and Wikipedia:Verifiability. 

If you are not """"notable"""" under Wikipedia guidelines, creating an article about yourself may violate the policy that Wikipedia is not a personal webspace provider and would thus qualify for speedy deletion.  If your achievements, etc., are verifiable and genuinely notable, and thus suitable for inclusion in Wikipedia, someone else will probably create an article about you sooner or later.

The fact of the matter is that the first patrol to come across the wreckage was asked to investigate because the Joint Defense Operations Center on base detected the sound of the plane crashing into the ground. Bear in mind that the sound detector is used to listen for mortars and would hear a """"missile"""" hitting the aircraft. Also, the reason the JDOC sent the first patrol to investigate was because the cameras that observe around the base were obstructed by the fog. This was the thickest fog I have ever seen. My section was the second section to be called up to respond to the crash. The first section to go out picked up the two barely surviving individuals and my section picked up the bodies with the pararescuemen. I was driving and I could barely see 75m ahead of my truck. There is absolutely no way that the enemy could spot the plane in the fog and shoot it down. Shooting down an aircraft is not an easy task for insurgents in the first place, shooting down a plane in that thick of fog, with a """"missile?"""" (insurgents don't have missiles), and having a """"missile"""" that doesn't make a sound is not possible and should not be given any credence. Also, the plane did not crash """"1.5 miles"""" from the base. The hull of the plane and all the wreckage was about 200m from the fence, consistent with an attempted landing. You seem pretty smug and sure of yourself but the fact of the matter is that all you did was read reports from unreliable Russian websites and fancy yourself with conspiracy theories.

He is constantly """"editing"""" discussion pages to make it look like he always gets the last word. Don't let him continue. He is a longtime vandal of these pages.
 

This anonymous user who declines to sign in, reveal itself and stand behind its words has failed to provide any solid edits with cited sources, preferring instead to bash Tommy Shaw & JY over their alleged hijacking of the Styx name.  I've called upon this user to provide for everyone exactly what info it wants to insert and provide verified sources for it and the user declined again, preferring to bloviate its opinions and sorrows about DDY no longer being in Styx and how they now suck because of it.  That doesn't constitute a solid contribution to an article.  This user also uses mulitple IP addresses to make people think that a cabal of people is backing up their claims, but they state NO FACTS & HAVE NO SOURCES for their edits, only opinions.

Go ahead and write all wiki articles as Tommy fansites. I think its probably transparent to most people out there. But I am done. You should keep making these announcements about me on talk pages. They don't make you look pathetic at all.

Sorry, I'm not.

In the 20th century it was brought back to life by the British, and thus became recognized world wide as """"Palestine"""". In any case, the Philistines themselves were not present yet in the land in the year 4,000 BC - they arrived around the time of the Israelites/Jews, and they settled mostly in a relatively small strip along the coast, an area which is partly the Gaza strip.

A few kind words
Obviously this is a subject that's intrinsically important.  It's worth caring about and you care; concern and dedication are good things.  The challenge is to direct that energy into positive uses.

Two years ago an editor approached me for help; he had a block log an arm long (seven edit warring blocks).  He was working in an important but controversial area.  We communicated.  Tentatively at first; then more closely.  Not only has he never been blocked since then, but he's become one of Wikipedia's most prolific featured content contributors.  He has since become a sysop at four different WMF sites, is an OTRS volunteer, and was recently reelected as an arbitrator at Wikinews.  He still edits that same controversial topic, and has written two-thirds of its featured articles and good articles.

What he told me about his blocks was this: he treated them exactly as blocks are intended to bebreathing room.  He'd go out, get fresh air, do other things.  Then return relaxed and refreshed.

 Thus those who see in the origin and contents of the Sikh
movement anything of this VaiSlJavism or the historical Bhakti

or cognate propositions, show a complete lack of understanding ofthe
real nature of Sikhism. Beyond the fact that Sikhism is of historical
proximity to this Bhakti movement of the Middle ages, and that it
somewhat partakes of the atmosphere and temper of VaiSDavist
climate, it has not much in common with the latter. Among the
principal features of this climate are its anti-Brahmanical attitude, its
preference for vernaculars26 over Sanskrit, its total surrender theory,
such as Lokacarya's marjara27 doctrine, its stress on devotion through
image-worship rather than through knowledge, and its own peculiar
forms of ritualism, such as caste-marks.

I just recall that De728631 has been considered involved after he blocked me during 3 days, a decision proven unfounded and cancelled after the appeal from  . It is cristal clear that there's nothing solved here, and I agree with ,  and  that the article has many other flaws that we could address first. 
 Culture: the section is indeed too big and should be thought as a glance inviting the interested reader to explore the Culture of Paris detailed article. We can also feel a certain trend to mix that section up with the more mainstream Culture of France article. I think an overhaul is necessary in order to focus more on the key elements to understand what is specific to the Paris identity: theatres, the movie industry, impressionist school, few key writers and singers, and the current state of today's Paris cultural life.
 Landmarks by district: that section, currently listing 450 different buildings, is totally unreadable in its current form. It should be replaced by a more general """"Monuments and Landmarks"""" section, if not by an even broader """"Visitor attractions"""" section with not more than 20 different mentions. Once again, there is already a standalone article for the Landmarks in the City of Paris which is more reader-friendly for those wanting to explore a more detailed list of those.
Even if that doesn't solve ongoing conflicts, focusing first on these 2 sections is probably the best way to get back to more constructive contributions to the article.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

OK finally got around to typing this.

1. The Forgotten was released as an official single for the Twilight soundtrack. I think most people remove it because they think it was a ¡Tré! single, which it wasnt. Green Day announced a while back, along with Twilight, That it would be the soundtracks lead single.
2. Shoplifter has been here forever with no complaints. The one I saw recently was """"Surely not Shoplifter"""" so they removed it based on opinion. And as for the other we had an agreement a while back to keep this one but people have started removing it again. This was a collaboration from Green Day and Husker Du. It was an """"official released Split single"""". One side was the original version and the other Green Days version from """"Warning"""". But either way both are sourced and the source is reliable and many other sources on this page come from this site as well. 
This one I dont see any complaints about. It never had a war to remove and only was reverted a while back. Various other ones have this section and its not that long. So it doesnt make the page to huge and not every discography """"has to have one"""". I dont think that this is a problem and it really does make the article more complete. The only thing missing is demos if we want to add them.

 So this is what I think and what do you say about adding demos. Its not to many and wouldnt be a problem with sources and what not.

bbc5c82d0cfd3409,"It's kind of a moot point.  Another point is that as long as we are getting into particulars, naturopathic medicine is NOT a medical system.  Allopathy, Osteopathy, Chiropractic, even TCM are medical systems.  Naturopathy is a mixture of other medical systems but not its own system.  For purposes of law a naturopath should have a separate license or certification for every medical system employed.  So for example if allopathic blood tests or pharmaceuticals are used then a license in Allopathic is needed.  The license specifies that kind of practitioner for that type of practice.  TCM and Chiropractic are licensed in the same way.  Naturopathic doctors seem to be requesting an all inclusive license to practice any kind of medical system that they want.  Naturopaths do specifically have homeopathy as a medical system however homeopathy is nonsense and everybody knows it.  You would all do yourselves a HUGE favor if you got rid of that one practice.  Don't bother sending over the studies.  I've already seen them and if you don't understand what is wrong with those studies then you just proved my point about naturopathic students not coming from serious research programs.  Another thing to keep in mind is that we all know that the medical establishment has problems but that doesn't prove that naturopathy is effective.  This is a basic logic equation.  Those two things are mutually eclusive.  The medical establishment doesn't work because of all of the periferal garbage that keeps practitioners from being effective at what they do and not because the medical system itself is ineffective.  Western medicine if highly effective when it is allowed to work unencombered.  Another thought about naturopathy is that you should take some notes from the TCM people.  They want TCM tested by western scientific standards and the result has been that thier system of medicine has proven itself effective.  In areas where it has been proven ineffective, they are happy to acknowledge it as ineffective.  If Naturopathy did the same then homeopathy would out of the picture almost immediately.  The difference is that TCM practitioners know that thiers is founded in a belief system that over time has become an effective medical practice and where belief will no longer suffice, they are happy to scrap it.  The result, TCM practitioners are licensed at the masters level and the final stages of the OMD degree with full licensing nationwide is well underway with support from the medical establishment.  In fact they will have this licensing while you guys will still be insisting that homeopathy works.  What's worse is that you guys have been in practice for much longer than TCM has even been in the U.S.  Something to think about.  You have to answer the problem of not having a unique naturopathic system to test as well.  Therein lies the problem of being in a position of requesting an all encompassing license to practice anything and everything.  The practice has to be defined properly to be licensed and must be disinguishable from other practices.  It cannot simply be a combination of parts from other licensed practices.

That is an interesting spin on your earlier comment: my views have """"zero validity"""" on my talk page, but """"100% validity"""" at an RFC. I am not sure I can make a cogent response to these conflicting statements.
In answer to your question, I think it important to maintain clear personal boundaries when it comes to disputes between editors. Not accepting personal attacks is one such boundry, another is courtesy, and another is mutual respect. If these personal boundries break down, subsequent discussion can degenerate into generalised mudslinging, which I think is what happened with the RFC's I have been the subject of. These RFC's have brought accusations that are too generalised to either prove or refute. As a generalisation, it is generally a good idea to avoid accusations based on generalisations, because I would end up being painted in a bad light whether I particiated or not.  
With regard to the RFC, the lack of courtesy shown by not being notified of a draft being started is indicative of a lack of respect for myself, or at least that is my personal view (valid or not). Evidence support this view is indicated by the fact that if the proposers of the RFC were really interested in resolving their personal disagreements with me, they would have brought their pet peeves to this talk page first, and we could resolve them in an amicable way. Unfortunetly, that did not happen. I can only speculate why, but I think it has something to do with the inabilty of a group of editors (myself included) not being able to come to shared understanding of how notability applies to certain topics.
I am a reasonable editor, and I am confident when it comes to disputes (personal or editorial), a that shared understanding of the issues involved can be reached. But it can only come about in an atmosphere of mutual respect and courtesy. (talk|contribs) """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Hi again   I really think the solar sail people are a bit optimistic about its use for interstellar travel.  The reason is just that as the acceleration is slow, you have to wait a long time, and travel a long way, to reach high speed.  At a uniform acceleration a, you reach velocity v after traveling a distance s according to 

 v = sqrt(2as)

in Newtonian approximation, which is applicable at the speeds we could hope to reach.  Then

 s = v2/(2a)

and for a given v, s gets very large if a is small.  But since the intensity of sunlight decreases like 1/s2 with distance from the Sun, a does not remain constant, but drops rapidly, making things very much worse.  Once you get out to well beyond the orbit of Pluto, where the Sun begins to look like a very bright star, the photon drag of the light of other stars begins to become significant, as well as the cosmic background radiation, which has an energy density comparable to that of starlight.  Finally there is the problem that at really high speeds, the light of the Sun would begin to be red shifted, so you lose power from that effect too.  Some of these problems can be solved by beaming light or microwaves out to the ship, with a huge power station (a trillion watts, say) near the Earth, and a large aperture mirror to focus the beam on the ship.  Then, as long as you can maintain the focal spot as small as the ship's sail, you could get constant acceleration.  A calculation I did years ago (which I will not try to reproduce now...) suggested to me that speeds of maybe  0.1c could conceivably be reached in this manner (which is very exciting) — but then, somehow, you have to stop.  

(For example, if I recall, if the aperture of the beaming mirror is R, the ship sail dia r, the distance from the Sun D, and the wavelength λ, then you need 

 λ/R = r/D

and acceleration 10-3g will get you to 0.03c in 30 years, at a distance D of 0.5 light years, 1018/2 cm, which makes the mirror R ~ 50 km in diameter for a sail r 100 km, with a 1 um λ.  NB the mirror needs to be optically perfect to << λ, but the sail does not.)

Of course 0.1c is a useful speed, and you might split the problem between a beamed laser sailer, with a fusion rocket to stop, but the trillion watt figure I remember was for a fairly small ship, 100 or 1000 tons if I recall, and I think a nuclear-electric ship capable of reaching even a few percent of c is going to be much larger than that for a payload of 100 or 1000 tons.  I cannot imagine a decade ship smaller than an aircraft carrier, so it sounds like a pretty tough way to go, though possibly competitive with other approaches.  

What I personally think we need to do is work the problem modestly hard from an engineering standpoint, considering all approaches, producing realistic design mission studies that give us the best trade-off solution with current technology.  Right now the trip time, for a program we could realistically sell to the combined economies of the planet, would probably last a thousand years or more.  So in ten or thirty years we should redo the study, and see how that number has changed due to technological advances.  At some point the curve of reasonable trip times will either get down to the order of the time between studies, or else it will flatten out when we hit the wall of feasible engineering.  Or maybe there will be a huge breakthrough when somebody figures out how to create a wormhole to a nearby star, or something equally revolutionary.  Anyhow, only when the trip time is getting down to the time between studies (which would depend on the rate of technology change) would it be sensible to start a serious program, with what NASA would call a """"Phase A study"""", leading to a program start, then a Preliminary Design Review, and then a Critical Design Review,... which is when you can start cutting metal. 

Solar sailing is probably a competitive way of getting around the Solar System, though I think nuclear-electric ion drives are likely to prove better.  The latter can certainly take us all over the Solar System in the time scales of the great explorations of the 15th and 16th centuries.  Then in 500 years the Solar System will be ours, and we will have a far better idea of exactly what is out there in the dark between the stars, possibly mini-solar systems like Jupiter & its moons.  If such systems are common, we might find useful places to go only 1% as far as Alpha Centauri, which would change everything.  And the human species would be safe at last from the many disasters which threaten us now.

2)Spreti says that Johannes Barbaro, prester, with a clear autograph was capable for the concession in 982 for the church of Santo Zorzi?, p274

3)Spreti says that by 992 the Barbaro were Authorities of the Republic and were part of the patriciate at the serrata for the Great Council in 1297?, p.275 

4)Spreti says that the imperial eagle was """"framing"""" Francesco Barbaro's arms, not quartering, which the old Italian word  looks like, p.275 

5) Spreti says that after the Congress of Vienna (Sovr. Risoluz.) which was assembled to give back what Napoleon took, the (original nobility) as Spreti states both the titles of Patrician of Venice and Nobile were authorized. 

6) Spretti says that Alessando Barbaro (1764-1839) was a member of the Council of Ten, High Counciler of the Supreme Tribunal of Verona, and owner of Palazzo Dario, p-277-288

7) Spretti also talks about the aviation achievments of Aldo Barbaro as well, p. 278

The empire installed Boleslaus and Mieszko as dukes of Silesia, who held both duchies in fief from the empire. Even the Duchy of Poland, the Polish dukes pledged allegiance to the empire and held territory as fief. Only in 1025 did Boleslaw I Chrobry declare himself king and died the same year.

Whether you think islam is false or not is irrelevant, as a christian I might be nclined to think that Judaism and Islam are 'false', you say that we 'have' to believe islam is false because I am a Christian, no this is not the case, depending on what you mean by 'false'. Certainly I do not follow all the teaching of the Quran, but there are many good suggestions about how to live ones life in the Quran, some of which also exist in christianity, some of which dont, so I dont think islam is 'false'. You may think islam is false, whats to stop me turning around and saying to you Judaism is false? I could probably give you a hell of a theological argument for saying why Judaism is false,. but I do not believe it is completly false, and at the end of the day whatever argument I may provide whether a religion is 'false' or not is merely a biased opion. So what if Bless sins may have a pro-msulim leabing, we all have bias in our approach, and in fact I would say that your bais against islam is far more agressive and evident than that of Bless sin's pro-islam bias. Dont pretend you are some omniscient perfect observer, becase as your edits show that would be a clear and arrogant lie to yourself, and my only advice to you is to refrain from being hypocritical.86.150.147.133  User: R.G.P.A

{{unblock|That is absolutely false. I absolutely did not """"make a personal attack"""" on you. Dishonestly claiming a false pretext to block me is a reprehensible abuse of your authority. Since the stated reason for this one-week block is wholly spurious, absolutely false, I demand to be unblocked immediately.

Not only did I never make any """"personal attack"""" against you, admins will observe that I actually thanked and praised you for intervening, which I also did in my private email message to you. This pretext for a one week block is absolutely spurious. You're making a minor disagreement on a tangential point on the Talk page into something personal and abusing your authority.

As for your comments on the Talk page:

 I never accused you of making ad hominem arguments, I asked you to calm down  WP:DISENGAGE.

I was never not """"cool"""" to begin with, so it's unnecessary to tell me to """"calm down"""", """"cool down"""", etc. Moreover, you said to me: """"I see some efforts being made to try to work out the differences, they will not be worked out if you resolve to not negotiate and dig in your heels. Respectful discussion free of attacks is the best way to do this ..."""" This implies I had made """"attacks"""" on people in lieu of trying to negotiate a solution reasonably. But like I said, and as you seem to now acknowledge, I never employed any ad hominem arguments (i.e., """"attacks""""). Moreover, any administrator can go to the Talk page and see for themselves that I've gone to extraordinary lengths to negotiate a reasonable solution with other editors.

 You can be right about something and still be wrong  META:DBAD.

I don't know what it is you think I am """"right about"""" but still """"wrong"""" about. But you seem to be implying I'm being a """"dick"""". I challenge you to present any quotes from me evidencing your implication that I've been a """"dick"""", i.e. by making """"personal attacks"""". You'll find you are unable to do so.

 You have engaged in a level of rhetoric that has created a hostile atmosphere (WP:CIVIL), you refuse to relent from your positions and you attack the positions of others with walls of text and barbs (WP:DBF). You've had editors ask you to calm down and you've had admins ask you to calm down and yet you've attacked anyone who has asked you to  WP:NOTTHEM.

Again, this is a false characterization. Every response of mine to others arguments has been to address the facts and logic of their arguments, as I am doing here with you. I have in no way been uncivil either with you or the other editors engaged on the Talk page. I have discussed diverging views and made numerous concessions to others on the Talk page in order to come to a consensus. My replies to others on their positions have consisted of substantive responses on points of fact and logic, never """"personal attacks"""" or """"barbs"""" (""""walls of text"""" might apply, as I've gone to extraordinary length to outline my own views and to support my own arguments with facts and logic).

 # """"Unhelpful"""" is not a word.

Thanks for the correction. I'll reiterate: """"Kindly quote me where I ever employed any ad hominem arguments, as opposed to addressing the facts and logic of the argument(s) put forth. You'll find, Wgfinley, you're unable to do so. So kindly refrain from suggesting otherwise. It's not helpful. Cheers.""""

Incidentally, it is apparently this comment you here regard as a """"personal attack"""" against you. Any other admin can see for themselves I did not attack you here. On the contrary, I merely observed here that you had characterized ME as making """"attacks"""", when I had never done so. You're making this personal and abusing your authority.

 This is the first thing you posted immediately after your previous ban expired (WP:NAM) followed by open questioning of your ban even being valid, it appears you need more time to cool down, 7 days should do.

You have not substantively addressed even a single point in my argument why my previous ban was wrongful. Yet you block me further on an even more spurious pretext  this time an absolutely false allegation that I attacked you personally. Other admins can confirm I never once did so.

 If you come back from this block and engage in more vitriol here again I'll have no choice but to take further sanctions and ban you from editing or discussion on this article per WP:GS.

On your further mischaracterization of any of my remarks of mine as """"vitriol"""", see above.

I would request that whatever admin makes a decision on this that you please substantively address my points here. The stated reason for my being blocked for 1 week is that I made a """"personal attack"""" on Wgfinley. Admins will find that I have never once done so. This block is therefore inappropriate and an abuse of authority. As such,",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Your role as copyright enforcer 

You removed a video link I posted to the [Jimmy Rushing] entry, insinuating, but offering no evidence, that it the posted video violated copyright. Google determines what videos violate copyright on YouTube, and I fail to see why you are in a better position to know than Google is, unless you are the copyright holder. Google removes videos when a valid claim of copyright violation is made, and before that there is no assumption (and certainly no proof) that the video violates copyright. You have not demonstrated that you have special copyright expertise, and even that would not give you special knowledge about a given video. You merely draw you own conclusions, which override those of Google, and do as you wish. If I can't know if a video violates copyright, how can you know? And if you do not have such factual knowledge, why do you assume a violation, and the right to delete a link? Please explain any knowledge you have that the video in this instance violates copyright. If you do not have that factual knowledge, please explain why you have the right to act as if it does violate copyright. Do you know of any legal precedent for holding a person or entity liable for linking to a copyrighted item without knowledge that there is a copyright violation? According to the Digital Media Law Project, """"As long as you do not know that a work infringes someone's copyright, then you cannot be held liable for contributory infringement for directing users to that work."""" The mere mention of the video being available from Rhino  which has now apparently allowed the video to go out of print  is not proof of copyright ownership.

3 citations have been provided and the funny thing is two of those are famous historian books which

2. pg 149,159 from A History of the Early Dynasties of Andhradesa, by B.V Krishna Rao

The third book by Mr. KB Chaudary is unreliable as it is not inline to wiki standards (WP:PRIMARY, WP:OR and WP:SYNTHESIS)

Re 
I tagged Byron Long for speedy deletion since it appeared to be entirely unreferenced, which, given the controversial nature of the subject matter, would constitute a serious WP:BLP violation.  WP:BLP states that Administrators encountering biographies that are unsourced and controversial in tone, where there is no NPOV version to revert to, should delete the article without discussion (see Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion criterion G10 for more details).  Looking through the page history, however, it appears that there actually was a reference for the article, which I have restored.  
CSD G10 does use the term """"negative in tone"""", which is a somewhat unfortunate choice of words.  The more fundamental policy here appears to be Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons, which states that """"biographies that are unsourced and controversial in tone"""" should be speedily deleted.  The underlying issue is not whether we believe that a description of a living person as a """"porn actor"""" is actually negative.  Rather, for WP:BLP purposes, the issue is whether, if an article incorrectly described someone as a """"porn actor"""", such a description would be regarded as defamatory for the purpose of Wikipedia:Libel  that is, whether such an incorrect description, if widely believed, might be likely to have a significantly adverse effect on the employment prospects or general reputation of the subject of the article.  I would contend that describing someone as a """"porn actor"""" is sufficiently """"controversial in tone"""" to invoke WP:BLP concerns for the speedy removal and/or deletion of any unreferenced claims of this nature.

Just to add to this, the most recent ofstead report strongly emphasises the need for student and teacher relationships to improve. however, because of the senior staff all living in the 1930's, they took this to mean they need to enforce the rules more, with stronger emphasis on uniform and weaker emphasis on educational support; this has simply degraded student's relationships with their teachers (especially the so - called """"senior staff"""" who don't even teach but instead spend their time punishing people for petty things - the school even employs a certain member of staff whose job it is to be horrible - ironically she is actually called Mrs Horrod!) even further.

The original intention of UNRWA was to abate the immediate humanitarian situation, then help Palestinians integrate into their new host countries. Palestinian refugees generally refused integration, as did host countries and donors, which is why UNRWA eventually gave up on integrating them. It is correct to call this a political decision rather than a strictly humanitarian one, but the alternative - pressing for integration - would also be a political decision rather than a strictly humanitarian one, so cries of UNRWA's politicization are fairly silly.

RE: MPT
Hi it has come to my attention that it is only the english articles that uses """"MRT"""" instead of """"MPT"""" which is used in the rest of other language wiki articles especially the Macedonian one. Debunking your romanized alphabet argument, it could be seen how even the logo has put """"MPT"""" in a romanized alphabet form therefore should be the one to be followed. It is practice here in wikipedia to use the official naming used by the one being described in the article no matter what their translation to english might be such as Volkswagen which in direct romanized translation is """"Folkswagen"""" but the former prevailed due to it being the one used in the official logo of the company albeit being romanized too. I understand your argument on the main article """"Macedonian Radio Television"""" that is why I kept that because its original name would not make sense in an expanded form here in english wiki. But its acronym should not be meddled upon especially it has a logo to prove it and the main article could provide the knowledge why MPT and what is its translation to english.Lastly the MRT 1 and MRT 2 pages should be really up for a disambiguation as the MRT worldwide may refer to Mass Rapid Transit or an equivalent rail term.

Converses, they are amazing. if you are """"gangsta"""" they do wonders for you <3

When the U.S. entered World War II in 1941, Converse shifted production to manufacturing rubberized footwear, outerwear, and protective suits for the military. Widely popular during the 1950s and 1960s, Converse promoted a distinctly American image with its Converse Yearbook. Artist Charles Kerins created cover art that celebrated Converse's role in the lives of high school and college athletes.
Converse Jack Purcells

Through its shoes, Converse developed into an iconic brand, and came to be seen as the essential sports shoe. In the 1970s, Converse purchased the trademark rights to Jack Purcell sneakers from B.F. Goodrich.[2]

Converse lost much of its apparent near-monopoly from the 1970s onward, with the surge of new competitors, including Puma and Adidas, then Nike, Inc.Nike, then a decade later Reebok, who introduced radical new designs to the market. Converse found themselves no longer the official shoe of the National Basketball Association, a title they had relished for many years. While being employed at Converse, one of its employees, Jim Labadini (1968-78), created the chevron and star insignia / logo that still remains on most Converse footwear items that are not classic Chuck Taylors.

The loss of market share, combined with poor business decisions, forced Converse to file for bankruptcy on January 22, 2001. In April 2001, Footwear Acquisitions, led by Mardsen Cason and Bill Simon, purchased the brand from bankruptcy and added industry partners Jack Boys, Jim Stroesser, Lisa Kempa, and David Maddocks to lead the turnaround of America's Original Sports Company.

The new team drove Converse from the 16th largest footwear company to number 7 in less than 2 1/2 years, leading to a buyout by rival Nike on July 9, 2003 for $305 million, qualifying as the merger and acquisition of the year in 2003.[3]

Current NBA players wearing Converse include Kyle Korver, Maurice Evans, Udonis Haslem, Elton Brand, Louis Williams, Larry Sanders, Luke Harangody, and Chris Andersen. """"Big Baby"""" Glen Davis wore Converse mainly for away games for 2011-2012 while also wearing Nike for some home games. JJ Barea and Kirk Hinrich were former long-time endorsers who switched to Nike during the course of the 2011-2012 season.
Converse skateboarding

Converse launched its skateboarding program in 2009 with a team of """"ambassadors"""": Anthony Pappalardo, Nick Trapasso, Sammy Baca, Ethan Fowler, Raymond Molina, and Rune Glifberg.[4]

In 2012, the company added Jason Jessee and Mike Anderson to its ambassadors team.[5]
Shoes
Chuck Taylor All Star basketball shoe
Red Chuck Taylor All Star basketball shoe
For more details on this topic, see Chuck Taylor All Star.

The Chuck Taylor All Star shoe has developed a number of nicknames over the years, such as: """"Cons"""", """"Connies"""", """"Convics"""", """"Convos"""", """"Verses"""", """"Chuckers"""", """"Chucks"""", """"Converse"""", """"Chuckalos"""", """"Chuckies"""", """"Chuck Ts"""", or """"Chucker Boots"""" or """"Chuck Taylors"""" for the higher styles.[citation needed] For decades the Chuck Taylor All Star basketball shoe only came in black, with a white variant released in 1947. Under pressure from basketball teams Converse decided in 1966 to manufacture other colors. Different materials also began to be used, starting in the 1970s, including leather, suede and vinyl, and even hemp, rather than just canvas. Besides high-tops, low-cuts and later knee-high versions were produced.
The Weapon
The Weapon, manufactured in many different color schemes

In 1986, Converse released """"The Weapon"""" basketball shoe. Manufactured in two color schemes to match the kit colors of basketball teams, it has been available in both high-top and low cut varieties. The unique aspect of this shoe is the leather construction throughout, including the inside heel which is also heavily padded for comfort. Converse re-released """"The Weapon"""" classic (which Kobe Bryant wore at least three times in 2002 and Andre Miller wore numerous times in 2002 from mid August to early September) several times from 2001-2003 and after, """"The Loaded Weapon"""" in 2003, """"The Weapon 86"""" in 2008, and """"The Weapon EVO"""" in 2009.

The first endorsers of """"The Weapon"""" were Larry Bird and Magic Johnson, who were prominently featured in a Converse commercial set in Bird's hometown of French Lick, Indiana in 1986. They were also worn by Axl Rose in the Guns N' Roses music video """"Estranged"""".

 Luis Miguel Gallego Basteri 

I would consider your move from Luis Miguel to Luis Miguel Gallego Basteri as a highly controversial renaming of an article. Please do not take offense, but I am positive that you are not familiar with this topic, or Spanish culture in general. Here are my thoughts on this:

 Luis Miguel is a singer of worldwide fame and much more notable than the other four Luis Miguels that you included in that disambiguation list.
 Luis Miguel is much more of a public figure than any other Luis Miguel, since he is a Grammy winner and is often romantically associated with big stars, such as Mariah Carey, Daisy Fuentes, etc.
 Please also note that """"Luis Miguel"""" is his professional name, and that is why he is notable, he is not a scientist or politician or any other profession where a full name is used. 
 Also only one of the other Luis Miguels has an article, therefore people looking for """"Luis Miguel"""" will be taken to that disambig page while almost all of them will be looking for the singer and not anybody else. 
 In addition, none of the other Luis Miguels go by """"Luis Miguel"""" only the singer. 

I will strongly suggest you moved the page back to Luis Miguel and create another Luis Miguel (disambiguation) page.

It should be noted that the conditions in which individuals died varies from site to site. The people that were buried in these graves are believed to have been members of the Kurdish population which was in support of Iranian occupancy of Iraq at the time of their death (circa 1980's) 'and who deserved to die in the hands of patriotic Sunni Arabs of Iraq'. The legitimacy of claims of atrocity are debateable for this reason, 'since Sunni Arabs are too honorable to do any such things'. The distinction between those who have died in military style combat or executed under the direction of a lawful court of President Saddam Hussein, although buried disrespectfully, and those who have been victims of genocide, ethnic cleansing or otherwise murdered innocently and buried efficiently is a bright line; mass burial should not be assumed to be evidence of criminal activity.

In reply to  you state in your edit summary for the """"Existence of God"""" article: """"Undid revision 256247715 by 74.4.222.208 (talk) Difference is of opinion is not vandalism. Omega point is fringe."""" That claim doesn't even make coherent sense, besides the fact that you replaced a literate entry with an illiterate edit.

Even if one incorrectly thinks that the Omega Point Theory is """"fringe,"""" that has no logical connection with the edit that Jeffro77 made. Jeffro77 replaced this entrywhich is very similar to the version that existed there since October 31, 2008, with some improvementswith this entry, giving the excuse in his edit summary of """"WP:FRINGE,"""" which doesn't even make sense as an explanation for his edits: i.e., deletion of a number of citations; deletion of the information on theologian Prof. Wolfhart Pannenberg's defense of the theology of the Omega Point Theory; etc. As well, there's no need for the large displayed quote, as the previous entry already stated that Prof. David Deutsch doesn't agree that the Omega Point is God; furthermore, Jeffro77's edit deletes the mention of the fact that Prof. Deutsch endorses the physics of the Omega Point Theory.

In addtion, Jeffro77's edit isn't even literate, as he give the following mangled citation to Prof. Deutsch: """"Chapter 14: """"The Ends of the Universe,"""" with additional comments by Frank J. Tipler; also available here"""". Whereas the version before was properly cited: """"David Deutsch, The Fabric of Reality: The Science of Parallel Universes—and Its Implications (London: Allen Lane The Penguin Press, 1997), ISBN 0713990619. Extracts from Chapter 14: """"The Ends of the Universe,"""" with additional comments by Frank J. Tipler; also available here and here.""""

As stated above, Jeffro77's excuse in his edit summary doesn't even make sense, as it doesn't explain why he would delete mention of Prof. Deutsch's endorsement of the physics of the Omega Point Theory, particularly since Jeffro77 himself called Deutsch an """"eminent physicist"""" in his own edit (i.e., that statement wasn't there before): of which argues against the notion that Jeffro77 considers the physics of the Omega Point Theory as fringe. Further, Jeffro77 deleted mention of the fact that Prof. Wolfhart Pannenberg, who is one of the leading theologians in the world, has defended the theology of the Omega Point Theory and Tipler's position that the Omega Point is consistent with the Judeo-Christian God.

Additionally, while Jeffro77's """"fringe"""" claim's aren't even relevant to his edit, they have already been refuted numerous times. Indeed, Jeffro77 himself refutes this claim in this very edit of his: to state again, therein Jeffro77 himself called Prof. Deutsch an """"eminent physicist"""" in his own words. So obviously Jeffro77 himself must consider Deutsch's endorsement of the physics of the Omega Point Theory to be noteworthy, and yet he deleted this endoresement in an area where Jeffro77 himself agrees that Deutsch is eminently qualified and replaced it with a large displayed quotation regarding a matter that Deutsch has no qualification or erudition in, even though the previous version already clearly mentioned that Deutsch disagrees that Omega Point is God. Moreover, in this edit Jeffro77 deletes all mention of the fact that an actual trained theologian, Prof. Wolfhart Pannenberg, who is one of the world's leading theologians, has defended the theology of the Omega Point Theory.

As well, Prof. Tipler himself has defended the theology of the Omega Point Theory and his identification of the Omega Point as being God in a peer-reviewed academic journal: see Frank J. Tipler, """"The Omega Point as Eschaton: Answers to Pannenberg's Questions for Scientists,"""" Zygon: Journal of Religion & Science, Vol. 24, Issue 2 (June 1989), pp. 217-253. Regarding the physics, Prof. Tipler has published his Omega Point Theory in many peer-reviewed science journals, including a number of the leading physics journals such as Reports on Progress in Physics (one of the world's leading physics journals) and Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society (one of the world's leading astrophysics journals).

The Jazz Bird: Fact vs. fiction 
________________________________________

        Craig Holden's novel The Jazz Bird, is based on the 1927 murder trial of Cincinnati bootlegger George Remus. Here's a quick look at where fact and fiction converge and diverge: 
        George Remus, the killer 
        Fiction: A lawyer and pharmacist who comes to Cincinnati from Chicago in the 1920s with a scheme that makes him at least $20 million. He buys distilleries licensed to sell “medicinal” whiskey to drug companies and then sells the booze to dummy drug companies while shipping it to illegal customers. 
        Truth: A lawyer and pharmacist, he was a friend and co-counsel of famed defense lawyer Clarence Darrow. Mr. Darrow testified as a character witness for him at his trial. He came to Cincinnati from Chicago and turned a $10,000 investment into an estimated $80 million fortune in less than three years. He sold “medicinal” whiskey to legitimate drug companies he set up, then stole the whiskey from the drug companies. 
        Charlie P. Taft, the prosecutor 
        Fiction: He is the son of former United States President William Howard Taft and plans a career in politics. He fades away after losing the case. 
        Truth: He was the youngest son of the former president. He became Hamilton County prosecutor just a few months before the trial. His political career suffered a setback after the trial — he wasn't nominated for a second term as prosecutor. He did stay in politics, helping found the Cincinnati Charter Committee and serving as a councilman and mayor until his retirement almost 50 years later. He ran an unsuccessful race as a Republican for Ohio governor in 1952, the year George Remus died. 
        Imogene Remus, the victim 
        Fiction: She is the wealthy 25-year-old daughter of a high society family in Cincinnati. She is the wife of a World War I veteran left in a coma by a shell fragment when she meets George Remus. She tries, unsuccessfully to get Remus accepted by Cincinnati society. 
        Truth: She was a 35-year-old secretary in Chicago when she divorced her first husband to marry George Remus, who divorced his first wife to marry her. She entertained lavishly in Cincinnati in hopes of being accepted into Cincinnati society. The Cincinnati upper crust was willing to buy Mr. Remus' whiskey, but never accepted him, or his wife, as social equals. She was 39 when she was killed. 
        The trial 
        Fiction: George Remus defends himself, pleading not guilty by reason of insanity. He plays to the press and frequently disrupts the proceedings, which are likened to a Vaudeville show by the Enquirer. The jury acquits him in 20 minutes, recommends his release from the hospital in time for Christmas and drinks up at a party he throws for them. 
        Truth: That's all true.

Logan duked out for AP honor 
________________________________________

The Associated Press 
        ATLANTA — UC's Steve Logan was third behind Duke's Jason Williams and Kansas' Drew Gooden in voting for The Associated Press college basketball player of the year. 
        UC's Bob Huggins was fifth in voting for coach of the year. 
        Logan received eight votes, Williams 38 and Gooden 18 from the 72-member national panel that selects the weekly AP Top 25. 
        Huggins got 7 votes behind Pittsburgh's Ben Howland (16), Bob Knight of Texas Tech (11), Ernie Kent of Oregon (10) and Roy Williams of Kansas (9). 
        Williams, the only unanimous All-America selection this season, is the second straight Duke player to be selected national player of year and the fifth Blue Devil to win the Adolph Rupp Award. 
        Shane Battier won last season. The other Duke players to be honored were Elton Brand in 1999, Christian Laettner in 1992 and Art Heyman in 1963. 
        Williams thanked his coach, Mike Krzyzewski, who missed the ceremony after undergoing hip replacement surgery on Wednesday. 
        “Being with Coach K the past three years is the best thing I could have ever asked for,” Williams said. “I owe him everything.” 
        Williams, a junior also voted to the All-America team as a sophomore, averaged 21.3 points, 3.5 rebounds and 5.3 assists for the defending champion Blue Devils (31-4), ranked No. 1 for all but four weeks this season. He shot 45.7 percent from the field, including 38.3 percent from 3-point range. 
        Howland led the Panthers (29-6) to the most victories in school history, their first appearance",0,0,0,0,0,0

I'll say this, as one of the very few truly experienced patrollers; most patrollers are not particularly good, and copyvios in particular can take considerable skill to pick out.  With this group, it's made somewhat easier by the fact that most of them show obvious signs of being second-language speakers, so English that looks a little too good gets my attention, but it's still not easy.  I've been working on another major issue for the last couple of weeks, but I intend to get back into NPP once that's cleared out; I have a list of the students so I know who I'm looking for, but I can tell you most patrollers will not, and with a few exceptions most won't know to carefully check them over.

Thanks.   Believe it or not in the real world I think that we think mostly alike on this.   I'm for the societal normalizaion of homosexuality.   I'm not for the nasty tactics used by some folks who feel that way, including branding anybody who feels otherwise as having a phobia.    And such work against themselves.     But in a Wikipedia sense, such opinions are not relevant.  Two definitions of the word exist, and one of them is sky-is-blue obviously controversial. The problem with the article is that, as a part of a POV quest, it pretends that the more controversial """"all opposition is phobia"""" definition is the ONLY definition. That would be just a difference of opinion but the more severe problem there is the nasty tactics used by a certain cadre there against people who do not agree with their quest.  I think that they have set the record for the amount of bogus tactics and bogus accusations used against a fellow editor.  And when I see people using such tactics against people in Wikipedia to further their purposes, I really see red.

And no I do not think that you are misguided.  I think that the real world you and your thoughts and efforts are right on track and admirable. And in Wikipedia you are a kind and thoughtful editor.  About the worst complaint I could muster is taking real life advocacy a bit too much into Wikipedia and having a bit of a hard time understanding my someone abstract analysis of the structure of the article, which is necessary to present the issues in Wiki-terms. But the first in very minor, and the second is somewhere between normal and being a failure of mine to explain better.  Your friend.North8000  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

(2) I have prsented sourced evidence from individual G8 websites, created by respective governments, that the EU is a member.  Nowhere is there any official statement that the EU is not a member. Some people are arguing that when it says the EU joined the G8, the word join has some special meaning (and they must therefore accept that Canada is not a member becasue I have shown the sentence where it says that both Canada and the EU 'joined'). 
(3) I have pointed out that most of the official G8 websites are quoting from the same source, so the contentious phrasing recure. 
(4) Lucy-marie quotes the sentence """"The European Union is represented at the G8 by the president of the European Commission and by the leader of the country that holds the EU presidency."""" Of course it is. This sentence in many sources follows on from the sentence that says that countries are represented by their Head of State/Government and is needed simply because the EU does not have a Head of State/Government. It doesn't mean anything else. 
(5) Lucy-marie further quotes """"The EU does not take part in G8 political discussions"""". Of course it doesn't: it would be quite wrong for the President of the Commission to do this since the EU cannot have a single view on these issues, being an association of many countries (some of which are represented in the G8 anyway). 
(6) Nowhere is there a source saying that the EU is not a member. I know, you can't prove a negative, but more significantly THERE IS NO SOURCE to say that the EU has partial membership, or restricted access, or observer status or anything other than full membership.

Hi, thanks for your thoughts. I have to disagree about your disambiguity-argument. You say """"Germany"""" can refer to either """"West Germany"""" or """"East Germany"""". This is - as I already stated - simply not correct, since there never was a country named """"West Germany"""" and there never was a country named """"East Germany"""", they were called those names in foreign media for simplicity reasons, as the """"Federal Republic of Germany"""" was part of the western capitalist world or first world, while the """"Peoples Republic of Germany"""" was part of Eastern bloc, or second world. Still this is not the correct term for the country, and is therefore no phrasing for an encyclopaedia. It is colloquial language that saves time, but still this doesn't make it the correct term. I do not make up names or use other possibly derogatory terms for other countries, and therefore would prefer, if wikipaedia articles are kept in a neutral tone too. So if there is really confusion to avoid, then the only correct way to do so, is to use the complete names of the country, and not some popular slang. To be honest, i didn't think there would be a confusion, and someone might think this final was between the Peoples Republic of Germany and England, and not between the Federal Republic of Germany and England (since the Peoples Republic of Germany only participated in one World Cup anyways). But that's probably me knowing already a lot about this topic and forgetting about people that know little about World Cup history, so i might be wrong. But if others do think the distinction is necessary, then please distinguish the teams with the real names of the country and not colloquial language. Finally i want to point out, that the link to Germany National Footbal Team leads to an article that already explains, that there were temporary governing football associations other than the DFB, so if there really is a confusion which German team this is, a click on the link of the team name will resolve that confusion.

Your second argument is, that """"most sources refer to that team as West Germany"""". That may be right, but is that really the deciding criterion? If i find, that most sources say, that eg Evolution is wrong, and Intelligent Design is right, will that decide the content of a wikipaedia article? I know it's a bad example, and i don't want to provoke a political or offtopic discussion, i just want to make to point that what many people say is not necessarily right. But unlike in discussions about """"most sources say Britney Spears is the best singer of all times"""" this whole thing is not up to taste, political views, scientific surveys, or speculations. It is simply a fact, that the name of the country this team represents is not """"West Germany"""", so it is not right to call the football team that represents this country """"West Germany"""". If you don't believe that this is a fact, then look it up on every government document of the Federal Republic of Germany, the name """"West Germany"""" is never used. And btw: it is not like, there is no source using the proper name of the team. It may not be the majority (i don't know tbh), but i am confident, that i can find a sizeable number of references using the correct term, which will be enough for every passage of this article. German sources use the correct term anyways, i could bombard you with thousands of sources in German language that use """"Germany"""" or """"FRG"""" or """"BRD"""", and not """"West Germany"""". At the end it is the souvereign right of a country to name herself (see also Macedonia vs Greece) and in English the """"Bundesrepublik Deutschland"""" has the official name """"Federal Republic of Germany"""" - or short """"Germany"""" - and has never called herself or referred to itself as """"West Germany"""", or """"Federal Republic of West Germany"""" or any other alteration including geographical terms. And the governing body of German football since 1900, the """"Deutscher Fußballbund"""" which translates into """"German Football Association"""" has never called itself """"West German Football Association"""" or referred to its players as """"West Germans"""". As i have already mentioned above, all Germans were eligble to play, whether they are from east or west or south or north. Even Germans born in other countries are eligible, like Paolo Rink born in Brazil, or Miroslav Klose/Lukas Podolski/Piotr Trochowski born in Poland, or Oliver Neuville born in Switzerland, as long as they have German ancestry. 

It is and was the explicit objective of the DFB to represent all Germans. This is exemplified when the Federal Republic of Germany played in eastern Europe, thousands came from the Peoples Republic of Germany to support the team from the other side of the Iron Curtain. They did that even though the Peoples Republic of Germany over time started penalizing people who support the """"class enemy"""" from across the border.

 About Operating Mode? 

Dear Sir or Madam,
I am so sorry to bother you, but I've seen your post on Processor Register, the original text is copied to bellow

| IA32e || 8 || 8 || Early concept of EM64T, coded name """"Yamhill"""". the register were extending from 32 bit to 64 bit. unlike x86-64 this design do not come with additional general purpose register(r8 ~ r15)and lack of 64 bit MMU and address mode. support 32 bit address mode with PAE for maximum compatibility with legacy application. early Prescott, Tejas and Timna were the only implement of this ISA and later is replaced by EM64T.

That is so interesting and amazing. Besides, I wonder the information on Operating Mode. Is the original IA32e mode a sub-Mode of protected mode or a new mode like it in AMD64? Does the original 32-bit protected OS need to be changed from the scratch or just provides extension support for those new introduced 64-bit instructions? That is most amazing thing for me.

 Warren Commission Exhibit 746-E  the """"Chin"""" 

It is time to confront the problem. Is the incriminating photograph of Lee Harvey Oswald a fabrication or not?  There is Oswald hold the rifle that blew the head off of JFK. And Oswald is carrying a pistol on his hip, perhaps the very one that was used to shoot the police officer named Officer Tippit. Not only that, Oswald has in his hands what people claim is left wing literature. 

The police found the picture immediately. Since the picture tied Oswald to the murder weapon, the police confronted Oswald with the picture right away. Oswald looked at the picture and threw cold water on the evidence that seemingly tied him to the murder weapon. 

Oswald, who some believe is a lying little rat,  said words to the effect: """"That's not me holding that rifle. Someone pasted my face on someone else's body.""""

Lets take a look at the Warren Commission's Exhibit 746-E and decide whether the face does look pasted on to the body as Oswald claimed. I'll get permission to put it on the page.

As I recalled, the RYM was an arm of the U.S. Labor Party headed by Lyndon Larouche.  Interesting that Larouche who years ago was involved in NYC politics through his proxy cnadidates running for local office right into the 80s never mentioned Sharpton, or his affiliation with RYM.
It is also curious how the media, even African American journalists failed to mention that the original arbitors of the forced eviction efforts of Freddies was its landords, a black Pentacostal Church!!!???  Nothing of this was ever mentioned by the press.  And Sharpton never gave a clue to the public. Amazing.  So, it is true the allegations of Sharpton being and agent provocateur.  There are more inconsistancies, like his perfidy of the United African Movement and betrayal of Alton Maddox.  Now, Rev. Al is cozy with Obama and the New York County District Attorney's office?

A question for   It may seem an odd question to WP purists, but considering the importance WP places on reliability of secondary sources, why does WP not require a same or similar vetting process of its editors, particularly those who seem to speak only for themselves?  The entire concept of requiring contributors to discuss/argue with a username is absurd in its most basic interpretation.  For all I know, I could be spinning my wheels fighting for accuracy with a demented, mind game-playing geek living in inner Mongolia.  It is imperative, in my mind, that those who demand respect offer up some sort of evidence, as I have, of their actual ability, credibility, reliability, accountability...  their authority to control.  If it's required of the sources, it should certainly be required of those who quote them and write about them.  Similarly, how do I """"call for consensus?""""

But that's not the main problem, which is that he's described in just about the same way as Kuribayashi Satoshi (栗林慧? くりばやし さとし, born 1939) is a renowned Japanese photographer. Or indeed Watanabe Kanendo (渡辺兼人? わたなべ かねんど, born 1947) is a renowned Japanese photographer. Or Orihara Kei (折原恵? おりはら けい, born 1948) is a renowned Japanese photographer. And so on and so on and so on. Which all means that somebody looking among Category:Japanese photographers is highly likely to land on a mere substub.

I can count on my fingers the people likely to turn a half dozen or so of these substubs into articles. No, on my thumbs: User:Pinkville and myself. But he's busy and I am too. I'd rate the probability that more than half will be converted within a year to more than stubs at well under 1%. It's an interesting """"proof of bot concept"""" exercise, but is it good for anything else? 

Tell you what: I'll match you one for one. You turn two of these into articles; I'll turn two into articles. You turn ten into articles; I'll turn ten into articles. How does that sound?   

That's a great challenge! You're on. –  (talk) (random) 

OK then. Do tell me when you've done one, as I can't keep the whole damn lot on my watchlist. Well actually I can, but I lack the time and effort to put them onto my watchlist. Also, I'll be intercoursingly busy during the next month, so in the short/medium term I may only be able to match you up to ten.

I'm sure I've got entire books by at least twenty of these substubbed people, so I ought to be able to do more.

What's odd about the list are some conspicuous absences. (Not just people I think are good, but people who, rightly or wrongly, are celebrated and successful.) Asai Shinpei is one, and there are more though I can't think of them right now. 

Not that it's any of my business, really, but did you scarf the list from User:20th Century Art (Zenhan)'s page, or do something else?   

Yeah, I scraped from Zenhan. I'll let you know here, or on your talk page, when I have one ready. I don't think I can make any of them featured, but legitimately """"non-stub"""" is the goal. All the best, –  (talk) (random) 

Okay, here's my first. Ichiki Shiro. It's not much beyond a stub, but it's something. (It took an hour of research, and I think I found all the info that's anywhere on the web regarding Mr. Ichiki.) By the way, was I right in listing him as a Hatamoto? My sources say he was a retainer of the Daimyo (in the Edo period, of course), and I know that he spoke with his Daimyo, so he couldn't have been a Gokenin. But I don't think he was a warrior, so I don't know. So far as I can tell, all Togugawa retainers were either Gokenin or Hatamoto. Am I correct in my inference? –  (talk) (random) 

Damn you're fast. 

Unfortunately I don't know squat about Tokugawa retainers and the like. On several occasions I've tried to interest myself in feudal history but have always fallen flat. I suppose I can't separate it from the hammily acted, cheesily lit TV period dramas I sometimes have to tolerate when at the in-laws'. LordAmeth might know. (And this photographer's right up Pinkville's street.)   

How's this for a progress indicator?   
Great! –  (talk) (random) 
Yup, except for a number of factors, one of which is that it's problematical copyrightwise (or so I infer from a comment elsewhere by one User:Quadell). I've already chucked in one extra list, and I'll certainly add one more, and I may add one after that; perhaps it can then be described as an original creation.

Hi Rholton.  What I'm trying to do here is create a good article that contains all the information on these towns that is presently in stubs.  All the stubs can then redirect to this article.  If they weren't just stubs, but proper articles, then there wouldn't be a point.  They are not about to become more than stubs though, as I created the stub on Euroa about a year ago and it's still a stub.  If some become large articles then I can just have a link to them from this article.  It can also link from """"list of victorian towns"""" which names each town.  By doing this you will now go to a large article instead of one stub, getting a better overview of the towns in victoria.  I'm still working on it, and I hope that you will give me a chance to finish before doing anything like a VfD.

 Three phases of post-WWII relationships between Romania and the Soviet Union 

OK, I've done some research and I'm sure I still don't know as much as the rest of you but at least I am not as much of an ignoramus as I was a few hours ago.

I've looked at a number of online resources, most of them non-scholarly, but I think it's enough to get a feel for what the situation is.  The source that I found most useful is: this one.

It's clear that there were at least three phases of relationship between Romania and the Soviet Union after WWII.  The first was """"legal occupation"""" between 1944 and 1946/47.  As Hamish and Prete say, """"The occcupation lasted legally from the signature of the armistice until February 1947, when peace treaties were signed in Paris...""""

The next phase of the relationship involves a nominally independent Romania that is """"closely aligned"""" with the Soviet Union and COMECON.  As for Soviet troops, Hamish and Prete say """"[after 1947], Soviet troops remained, but on a different legal basis, in Romania and Hungary.  The official reason was that (the Soviets) needed to control communications between the Soviet Union and Soviet occupation forces in Austria.  This reason disappeared with the conclusion of the Austrian State Treaty in 1955.  Instead, Soviet forces remained as Allied troops, and their status was more precisely defined with the signature in 1958 of the Warsaw Pact.""""

Now, we know that the Soviet troops were pulled out of Romania in 1958 and that Ceausescu took Romania on a path that diverged from COMECON but still remained enough in Khruschev's good graces that Romania never suffered a military incursion as Hungary or Czechoslovakia did.

The point here is that there are at least three phases of relationship between Romania and the Soviet Union.  The relationship between 1944 and 1946/47 was clearly one of occupation.  After 1958, everyone agrees that there was no more occupation of Romania.  However, between 1946/47 and 1958, it's not clear what people call it.  As Hamish and Prete state, the """"legal occupation"""" ended.  As cited here and in Soviet occupation of Romania, some sources state that the """"Soviet occupation"""" ended in 1958.  Others call it a """"virtual occupation"""".  Why virtual?  Because it had all the earmarks of an occupation except that it wasn't officially one.  (And thus my argument that we shouldn't call it an occupation because it wasn't one.)

What's the solution?  Here's my proposal...

First, stop getting caught up in what the title of the article says.  Let the Soviet occupation of Romania article remain where it is.  Mention the entire period of 1944-1958 under this title (i.e. Soviet occupations) but make it clear that there were three phases of relationship and, as I described it, """"the period from 1946/47 to 1958 had many of the characteristics of an occupation but was not legally considered to be an occupation"""".  Also add that many historians follow the lead of the Romanian government in calling the entire period from 1944-1958 an occupation by the Soviet Union.  

However, also note that it is unclear whether this characterization is used by """"most historians"""", """"many historians"""" or """"some historians"""".  In Soviet occupation of Romania, the text says """"most Western historians"""" but the references simply provide a handful of sources that use the word """"occupation"""" to refer to the period 1944-1958.  As someone argued, this could be just cherry-picking.  To support the assertion that """"most Western historians consider the period 1944-1958 to be a Soviet occupation"""", you have to find a source that says exactly that i.e. the text has to say """"most Western historians blah, blah, blah"""".  Failing that, using the word """"most"""" is OR.  Much better to say """"many"""" or just """"some"""".

 Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Macedonia 2 

This arbitration case has been closed and the final decision is available at the link above.
All editors on Macedonia-related articles are directed to get the advice of neutral parties via means such as outside opinions and Geopolitical ethnic and religious conflicts noticeboard (WP:ECCN), especially since there are significant problems in reaching consensus.
All articles related to Macedonia (defined as any article that could be reasonably construed as being related to Macedonia, Macedonia nationalism, Greece related articles that mention Macedonia, and other articles in which how Macedonia will be referred to is an issue) fall under 1RR whenever the dispute over naming is concerned.  Editors enforcing a case where a binding Stalemate resolution has been found are exempt from 1RR.
The following users have been banned from Wikipedia  one year, one year, and six months .
The following users have been topic-banned from Macedonia-related articles and their talk pages, as defined in All related articles under 1RR: indefinitely, indefinitely, one year and, one year.
The Committee takes note that  has resigned his administrator status while this case was pending, but also notes that he is desysopped as a result of the above case. ChrisO may obtain the tools back via the usual means or by request to the Arbitration Committee.
 is strongly admonished for displaying a long pattern of incivil, rude, offensive, and insulting behavior towards other editors and failure to address the community's concerns in this regard. Because of this Future Perfect at Sunrise is subject to an editing restriction for one year, and is desysopped for three months as a consequence of poor user conduct and misuse of administrative tools. After three months, his administrator access will be automatically restored.
Single-purpose accounts are strongly advised to edit in accordance with WP:SPA and other Wikipedia policies. Diversifying one's topics of interest is also encouraged.
Abuse filter 119, as currently configured, logs all changes involving the word """"Macedonia"""" but does not block any edits. The community is strongly advised to consider adding a new abuse filter criterion; any instances of changing the word """"Macedonia"""" to """"FYROM"""" (the five-letter acronym, not the full phrase) shall be prevented. 
Within seven days of the closure of this case, a discussion is to be opened to consider the preferred current and historical names for the four entities known as Macedonia. The discussion will end one month after it is opened.

 WW2 casualties 

I think some more narrative prose is a good idea. The main tables should still be there for easy lookup, but the topic is complex, often controversial, and different sources have different numbers. And all this could/should be elaborated on and explained in the article, yes. Many people will come to the page with numbers on their """"own"""" country that they have learned or read, and we should have some text explaining more thorowly what the numbers we list include. And that's probably best done outside tables and in addition to just simple footnotes.

Maybe we could also have separate casuality sections for the different (major) countries, with text and tables where there could be made room for lower and upper bounds on numbers and space for citing different sources and their numbers. Not so much that I expect you to find and look up every different estimate, but there are many people editing and there could be a value in having room for those comming here later with different sources to add to the information.

Confused
Don't worry but I think somebody got confused while usign LHD and RHD back and forth beetwen different countries, so for example, Spain is LHD or RHD? the part about Gibraltar made me get confused about it.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 98.226.204.140   

Gibraltar has not been part of Spain since 1713, so the British authorities applied their own laws, including the rule of the road. By 1929, driving on on the left while having a land border with a country that drove on the right became impractical, so that's why Gibraltar change on 16 June of that year.  

History
Do we have any reliable evidence about the historic foundations of LHD/RHD are? I think the article could benefit from adding any info to this effect.
On numerous occasions, I have heard that left hand driving has its roots in knights passing each other with the lances in their right hand. However, i have never been able to find any evidence of this. 
  

-Please do excuse me for sounding a bit daft, but I'm not sure I understand the question. Isn't that what the entire article is about? In addition, I think the problems ascertaining the specific history are quite well-presented.   

Sweden
Under Safety factors it says
""""Research in 1969 by J. J. Leeming showed countries driving on the left have a lower collision rate than countries driving on the right. This research is questioned in Peter Kincaid's book on the rule of the road,[citation needed] but some countries that have switched to driving on the right, such as Sweden, have seen their long-term accident rates increase by more than any increase in traffic volume[citation needed]."""" The red part is totally made up, and the opposite is the truth. The number of accidents was cut in half from the first day of right hand driving, and has not increased substantually since then. Swedish right hand driver 83.255.35.43  

H'm. This what you're saying doesn't quite make sense, either. The number of crashes will surely have gone up since 1967. Perhaps you mean the crash rate (per vehicle-kilometre travelled, per thousand vehicles registered, etc.) has declined, which would make sense since that's what's been happening in just about every first-world country over the last four decades. 

Nevertheless, the assertion you call attention to is unsupported, has been for quite some time, and at the very least is questionable. We can remove it from the article unless/until someone cares to add it back with reliable support. — T·C

 Dagen H videos 
If anyone else has found this already and beaten me to it, I'm sorry to be redundant. After a long night of trolling the internet for hours I finally came across the holy grail of Dagen H-related video. Here's the link.

It's from TV Sveriges. That link will take you to the live television coverage from 4.45am to 5.15am. There's yet another clip from 5.15-5.30 and further clips down the right-hand menu to different reports throughout Sweden at different intervals throughout the day. It chronicles the entire switch in immense detail, though be warned that the dialogue is entirely in Swedish (as is the website) so its main function is simply for those of us who draw immense excitement from watching these events transpire. The site also hosts (further down) the news bulletins for the various anniversaries right up to 1997. Again, if this has been posted before, I'm sorry, but for those of you who haven't seen this before, happy viewing.

On April 6, Nabil Sha'ath delivered a speech at a meeting of the Arab League, in which he charged that “a 'massacre' was underway in the Palestinian refugee camp of Jenin.” (Deutsche Presse-Agentur) He also “compared Israeli actions in the West Bank towns of Jenin and Nablus to the 1982 massacres of hundreds of Palestinans…” (The Associated Press). On April 7, Abdel Rahman told NBC’s Tim Russert, “The victims so far has been over 250 Palestinians killed, many of them are children and women.” Saeb Erekat is quoted by Washington Post as having said “This is not fighting between armies, but a massacre in Jenin camp.""""

 Midway = turning point 

In my view, if there WAS a turning point in the war on Japan, Midway has to be it. While the Japanese had been stopped at Coral Sea, they still had the initiative; they could still choose where and when to attack, and the allies had to react. But not after Midway! It was, after all, THEY that launched the Midway/Aleutians operation, and THEY that were then rocked back on their heels, and THEY that fled afterward. It was THEY that had lost 2/3 of their big, fast carriers (and the carrier was to the War in the Pacific what the ballistic missile was to the Cold War. Somewhere above someone argues that the remainder of the Japanese fleet was still a formidable force, but that is nonsense; all that force could do would be to sail out and get sunk by a carrier-equipped US NAvy)). Far from being """"merely"""" a tactical victory, it changed the whole complexion of the war. 

Now, while they DID attempt some more offensive action (notably by trying to take Port Moresby, again, this time over land via the Kokoda Trail in the 2nd half of 1942), this was all relatively minor, designed to strengthen their DEFENSIVE positions not to conquer, and was  ultimately almost all unsuccessful. They never again tried the kind of massive, seaborne, combined arms operation that had swept them across most of the Pacific in a just a few months. Then just 2 months after Midway the US landed on Guadalcanal, and clearly the initiative was ours, and Japan was in defensive mode. Thus the Guadalcanal campaign can't be considered the actual turning point either - by then the US was clearly on the attack.

I don't think the argument that there is no turning point because Japan could never have ultimately 'won' the Pacific war works out either. Japanese planners DID know that they could not win a long war MILITARILY but that was not their plan. Strategically their plans went something like: 

1. Start the war from as superior a position as possible (hence Pearl Harbor)
2. Race across the Pacific, seizing resources and territory BEFORE the US could gear up for war.
3. Attain as defensible a position as possible (Hence the Kokoda Trail offensive and takeover of the Solomons) and DIG IN.
4. Let the US grind itself down against near impregnable fortresses. 
5.Win a favorable peace settlement when the US tires itself out throwing itself against their defenses.

But they failed at (1) when they didn't sink the US carriers at Pearl Harbor, and only 6 months later Midway signalled the early end of (2). By the failure to take Port Moresby, they also failed at part of (3). They had some hope to succeed at (5); when the bloody costs of both Tarawa and Buna-Gona became known, US public opinion was shaken. Even as late as 1945, many americans found the though of the casualties invading Japan would cost to be appalling.

So, MY conclusion is that Midway WAS *the* turning point in the Pacific. I realize this whole idea of a turning point is rather subjective, but I really think if there was one in the South Pacific, it has to be Midway.

 Reply to your message about style issues and footnotes/references 

Hi! Just so you know, Template:cite news is the preferred way to cite news sources. Using the template allows us to easily modify references and easily keep all references in the same format. When editing a reference, please do not remove Template:cite news, as you did here. Also, there's no need to name references unless they're used more than once. Thank you.My way of including all references in an article is according to what I've found here and here that's close to the APA style. We are talking about footnotes that are references/citations to sources, right? Was not aware that a specific way to cite only the news, although it's a reference like any other printed source. 

Also, the reference was used twice, with the long version added at the first footnote (for example, such as this reference), and the shortened version used for subsequent mentions of the same citation (for example, such as in this case). If it matters that much for the sake of style and consistency, go ahead and change the format to one for news articles.

 Gave context to the article by linking the prison to the political life. 
 In the history section gave a better explanation of the existance of the prison by linking it to the failed coup d'état. Also added info about Mon ami le Roi book. Without a history section, the article reader would find no context to follow.
 I added  to the Saharawi inmates. 
 Added Years of lead as a see also as both subjects are related.

I removed:
 capacity for only 56 inmates. Not true. The reference given   talks about getting 56 detainees for the first time.
 summary executions occurred. In the reference we had , there is no such claim. The article puts it as a possibility. 
 The Al-Ahram weekly reference is about the book of Tahar Ben Jelloun and I put if on further readings and kept the link.
 Scorpions and snakes. I removed snakes as Al Jazeera link only reports scorpions.
 feracious is an adjective and by nature we avoid using adjectives in wikipedia in order to avoid pov issues. Cold winter is enough. 
 Surviving inmates have described the experience as """"being buried alive"""" is not well sourced. They may describe it in all possible words but weather someone said explicitly and exactly being buried alive or not, nobody is sure. I also removed a """"death camp"""" rather than a prison for the same reason while I believe that someone would have said it. But again, no sure. In case of statements declared by people, we have to be very carefull. 
 Approximately half of those imprisoned in Tazmamart eventually succumbed to diseases, torture or simply the winter cold, is removed because it is tackled in the same section. Duplidation.

Please check and compare the two versions if the articl's lost any encyclopedic content. Cheers     Wiki me up

He is now mostly retired and owns a small company, Bear Mountain Scientific, that he uses to fulfill various types of writing contracts. His company web site is BearMountainScientific.com.
Publications: Vernon R. Harris has published three books as of August, 2009. They are:
The Travelers - The Travelers, is a fiction story about a couple, Ray and Sue Barker, visiting a new town during a vacation where they met a very unusual couple one day. The couple they met is referred to as “The Travelers,” and their names were Carl and Collie. Ray and Sue visited with The Travelers for a while and even had lunch with them. What they learned about The Travelers and their backgrounds left Ray and Sue almost speechless. This is the story about the Travelers and their strange tales. It is a story of visitors or travelers from another planet but with a totally different twist. Those readers of the Christian faith will find this story especially interesting. Those readers who are science buffs or scientists will find this story very intriguing. Is the story of The Travelers possibly real, and not just fiction? Listen to the facts as they unfold, and you decide. ISBN:  978-1-61582-414-4

The Cats of Coward County - The Cats of Coward County is a fictional story about a scientific experiment that accidentally resulted in a group of cats developing some human like characteristics. Since they were cats first, their cat personality was dominate but they were able to develop new skills, and memories, and, they could talk. These are some of the humorous stories involved with this group of cats that try so hard to organize and develop their own little town, a town called """"Cat City.” The personality and humorous antics of each cat living in Cat City comes to life as the stories unfold. Mouser, a real cat, is fictionalized as the Father of Cat City and is recognized as the Mayor of the town and attempts to guide the other cats in the development of their town and solving it's many problems. The many stories are filled with humor showing how the cats dealt with their new found thoughts that are filled with both human and cat memories. You will be introduced to Cat City, how it got started, what it looks like, and how the cats make it work for them. You will get to know Vern and Pam who helped the cats get their town started and how they helped the cats organize all the different parts of their town. Vern and Pam, who lived close by, got involved only when it was absolutely necessary. We hope you enjoy meeting all the cats. The Cats of Coward County is designed to add a new perspective to your imagination and a sense of humor and how cats might evolve in these circumstances. ISBN: 978-1-61582-406-9

Sweet Water Canyon - Sweet Water Canyon is a fictional story about the trek of a group of pioneers crossing the country in 1859 from a Midwestern town and going west. They traveled together in a wagon train. Dozens of wagon trains had already made it across the country and had pretty well marked the way, if there is such a thing, for those that followed. They traveled by wagon train because the promised railroad going from east to west was far behind schedule and seemed like a distant, hope. It describes one type of hardship and danger the early pioneers had to endure. This is the story of one part of one journey and the impact it had on the entire wagon train. Readers of the Christian faith will find this story especially interesting. ISBN: 978-1-61582-405-2

Efrawc did not exist prior to Chretien de Troyes writing Perceval, so there can hardly have been a pre-Chretien Peredur tale; the fact that the character's name was drawn from a Welsh translation of Geoffrey of Monmouth, the earliest MSS of which dates to the mid-13th century century, further supports the argument that Peredur is post-Chretien. Regarding your question about courtly material, I don't really understand your point - obviously a Welsh author familiar with French culture could have incorporated elements from it into a native tale - but that doesn't seem to be the case here, as there is no evidence for a pre-Norman Peredur tale.

 Quick Question on Sephardic Jews... 

Hello all... i'm not a jewish person but have a great deal of interest in both Israel & Judaism, and have doubts as to the meaning of """"sephardic jew""""

Wikipedia & other i-net resources have given me the definition most of you will know (from Iberian peninsula, emigrating to the mediteranean region, etc...) but what raised my doubts is something else.

I recently saw a documentary which claimed that Sephardic jews originated from a tribe in a land adjacent to israel (in the north, though i forgot its ancient name). The king/leader of this tribe was deeply impressed with his jewish neighbours and converted himself, as well as all his people, to judaism...

I can find nothing to back this up, and would love any imput you're wishing to provide..

Until this edit yesterday, which smuggled in some changes under a misleading edit summary, the map/diagram simply used standard three-letter abbreviations for all the countries included, generating the common name of the country (including China and Taiwan), a link to the relevant country page and a flag icon. That was internally consistent in terms of format, clear and in line with our article names. The bid to change that - and introduce different formats with separate flag icons and name-links for China and Taiwan and also full-form names for the two of them - was, reasonably enough (and entirely correctly in my view), reverted. Rather than their trying to justify the change brefore reintroducing it, we then had various people edit warring the change, or variations of it, back in, often using bizarre edit summaries referring to Israel, WP not being ISO etc. I will restore the stable, prior, internally consistent version (I see it's just been changed yet again) and then perhaps can those obsessed with changing such a minor, trivial point put their case here first, before messing with it again?

Let's start from the beginning and move towards what we have. There was a boy who was born in 1805 who founded a religion. That in and of itself isn't that special. Lots of people started their own religions and churches. But he is different. He isn't just any religionist because he claims that he actually speaks with God face-to-face like prophets anciently. He claims that he received Golden Plates and he translated them by the power of God into the Book of Mormon. He claims to hold the keys to salvation. He claims that his is the only church that acts with real authority from God, and that all the other churches are imposters. Aren't you interested in what arguments have been made about whether or not he is a real prophet? If Joseph Smith merely claimed to be able to predict a few things, that would be one thing. But when a young boy claims incredible visions and revelations, comparable only to a handful of previous prophet's experiences, that is something else.  30 June 2005 00:45",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Notability Criteria - Clubs affiliated to Västerbottens Fotbollförbund 

Clubs playing in Division 4 and below may not meet Wikipedia's notability criteria.  If you wish to produce a Wikipedia page for your club I suggest that you ensure that you take appropriate measures to emphasise that your club is notable.  This may be achieved by including details of at least one of the following:

1. - club achievements in particular competing in the higher levels of the Swedish football league system (Division 3 and above 1987 onwards / Division 4 and above pre 1987); 
2. - a notable player(s) who has played for the club;
3. - widening the description of the club to include details of other sections of the club (some of whom may have made a notable contribution to their sport);
4. - significant club infrastructure that has been provided or is managed by the club such as an indoor sports hall and all weather pitches;
5. - special contribution to the local community such as clubs serving the needs of ethnic communities;
6. - unique features such as an island location or historic stadium.

Failure to meet notability criteria could result in your page being recommended for deletion.

 New page patrolling 

Please see this thread and consider giving new page creators some breathing room before tagging their pages for deletion. In this case, you tagged within 2 minutes of creation. Unless it's an attack page or something, give the editor some time to work with the article. Thanks, –xenotalk 
Admittedly I was on the fence in regards to this article and perhaps should have simply tagged it for improvement or as a stub. I allowed my review of the creator's block log to skew my opinion on an unreferenced bio. And I realize I misunderstood the inapplicability of G4's to speedy deletes.
But in general, as a NP patroller I feel that my purpose is to filter pages on creation.  With the volume of speedy deletes we generate, there are going to be occasional disputes regarding our reasoning.  However, in the vast majority these proposals for deletion are necessary soon after creation or the article will be lose the benefit of input from an experienced editor unless someone on recent changes happens to notice the article as it is being modified. If bad articles slip past this initial screening I feel it would increase the workload of the pool of editors as a whole.  This is just my own personal philosophy and I will attempt to avoid causing you too many headaches in the future.

Hey, how is it going? I am kind of stuck with a question about the population of a small place, and as I know that you deal with unincorporated small places sometimes I thought to drop you a line. I started that article about Randolph, Tennessee recently and I am so far pretty amazed that there is a lot of documented historical information to find about that place. Funny, if enough time passes, even about the smallest places there is something to say. Well, what I could not find out about is any recent population. As a matter of fact, I have a referenced population for 1820 (54), shortly before foundation of the town. And I have one good enough estimate for 1834 (1,000). In 1861 they had 5,000 soldiers there, but that does not really count as population, does it? Today it might be in the few hundreds, not much more. It looks like any population more recent than 1834 would be of great help here already.

I tried to find out about the voting precincts, but Randolph is included in the same voting precinct (14 S.W. Tipton) with a few other, larger communities. So you can't really start from there.

 Suggestions to impove the article 

There suggestions to improve the article. This is the comments from 

Lead

 Your writing has a lot of adverbs like """"originally"""" """"primarily"""" """"mainly"""", these aren't necessary.  Sometimes they have a place but they also clutter up the prose and many of them can be removed.
 Third cable channel behind disney and nick.  Third in what?  Kids' programming?  It's not clear.
 Overall in the lead the writing is choppy and needs to be streamlined.  Here's an example:
""""Since 2009, it began airing a small amount of live-action programming, specifically movies from Warner Bros. and New Line Cinema, both of which are also owned by Time Warner.""""  Rewrite like this, """"In 2009 it started airing live-action programming, including movies from Warner Bros. and New Line Cinema.""""  No one cares that they're owned by Time Warner.
 See WP:LEAD for instructions on what should be in a good lead.  The lead should be a summary of the entire article and this lead should be enhanced to include every subject within the article (written in a summary style).

History

 The clean up banner is legitimate and should be addressed.  Usually clean up banners should be handled before the article is listed at WP:PR.  I can see a number of  templates in the following sections.  These should be addressed and the sourcing improved.
 As a general rule every paragraph should have at least one source, and more if there are multiple assertions.
 See WP:INCITE for reference anchor placement.  They don't go in the middle of the sentence but rather at the end unless the assertion is very controversial.
 The parenthetical reference in the first sentence is too detailed.  Give a few examples of what was acquired and leave it at that.
 Watch out for one sentence paragraphs.  These stubs are not acceptable at GAC.  Consider combining or expanding.
 Make sure titles are always italicized even when not linked.
 What is meant by the """"Powerhouse era""""?  What is powerhouse music?  

Programming

 This is a section with no prose.  Not good.  Sections with just a tophat are unnecessary.  Either add some prose or remove the section.  I think you fold in most of the programming info in the previous section.

Related projects

 Here is a section """"Cartoon Network Universe: FusionFall"""" see above.

References

 The key to references is consistency.  Make sure every website ref has at least the title, url, publisher, and accessdate.
 You probably want to use templates like  to help with consistency.
 Deviantart appears to be a blog or discussion forum.  This is not a credible reference.  See WP:CITE and WP:VERIFY for instructions on credible references.  Avoid blogs, forums, chat rooms, social networking sites etc.

Overall

 As stated above the article needs a lot more referencing.  This will be a major sticking point if you want it to pass GAC.  * I would also seek out someone who can do a thorough copy edit.
 There isn't much about the financing of the channel, advertising revenue, demographics that sort of thing.  It would be nice to see some more information on these topics.
 This concludes my review.  Please contact me on my talk page if you have specific questions.  Best of luck to you.

I've fix the issue. Some movies were carried from 20th Century Fox, Paramount Pictures and Walt Disney Pictures which are not owned by Time Warner. I've improved some  it a little bit, but the article needs to be rewrite and remove any blog, user and fan sites which are not reliable. Any reliable sources can be added per WP:V and WP:RS. Remember,  is recommended. Good luck improving the article.  (Talk / Contributions) """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Rankings
Between 1988 and 2004, the school's position in BusinessWeeks biennial business school ranking has averaged around #5 and #6. BusinessWeek also ranks major academic divisions/disciplines; all of the school's divisions ranked in the top five in all nine surveys of the past twenty years. The magazine has consistently rated the major disciplines of the University of Michigan Business School in the top five since it launched its biannual ranking of professional schools in 1988. Only three other business schools can make this claim.

When BusinessWeek Online announced its """"Top Ten Management Gurus,"""" based on surveying executives worldwide, Michigan professors Dave Ulrich (rated number one), Noel Tichy, C. K. Prahalad and Michigan alumnus Gary Hamel, PhD 1990, dominated the list.

BusinessWeek'''s """"The Best B-Schools"""" report of October 2004 ranked the business school sixth overall among the best business schools, and fourth in leadership for its training efforts. In the same report, under the """"Best and Brightest"""" category for schools that produce graduates with the best skills, the business school ranked:
3 in Marketing 
5 in General Management 
7 in Ethics 
8 in Global Scope

 GayVN Awards redirects 

Thanks for your help in deleting the pages that were merged. However, I'm disappointed that the redirects weren't deleted, regardless of how """"cheap"""" they are. 

I can't find anything that says redirects have to be kept in the case of merging a page. (Which would make sense in most cases, I'm sure, but not when the name of the merged page is not one that someone would likely search for.) I can, however, find support for deleting them. Wikipedia:Redirect#When should we delete a redirect?, item 1. states, """"The redirect page makes it unreasonably difficult for users to locate similarly named articles via the search engine.""""

I believe that leaving the redirects meets this guideline. Here's the top of the results list when searching for """"gayvn"""", in order of appearance. There are 51 results listed. Redirects are marked (R); correct pages are bolded. Non-existent pages are italicized.

Having to slog through 15 extraneous """"hits"""" for non-useful redirect pages seems unreasonable to me; it's nearly a third of the search results. The redirects aren't useful as they are too specific to be considered likely search phrases.

User:24.167.138.84 may exist, but 24.167.138.84 is a volatile IP address. Keeping a comment directed at a particular user of a volatile IP address that may never be used by that particular user again, about a page that has been merged/deleted, seems needless. While equally useless, for some reason he doesn't show up in the search list. (More evidence that there's something wrong with the index.)

User:Overdrive10/Kent Larson and User:Overdrive10/Chris Steele show up further down on the list as well; neither of these pages contains any reference to GayVN (they're both blank); I'm sure they did in the past as they were probably sandboxes for articles. However, there has been no activity on either page since 16 June. 

User:Fabartus/Sandbox also shows up in the search results but doesn't mention GayVN anywhere on that page; nor has s/he done so since 13 April. That entry appears to be part of a copy and paste of another user's contributions log with comments, and was created by a user with an IP address (most likely Fabartus's, however).

In these cases and the case of the two pages listed above that don't actually exist but are being returned as part of the search results, I think there's an obvious """"glitch"""" somewhere - apparently in the search engine indexing. Is it not being refreshed on a regular basis? I thought it happened every 24 hours.

Any road, it would be nice to have the 15 redirect pages removed and their entries in the search results eliminated (and I'm not sure that the former results in the latter). Equally desirable would be to have the search index updated to reflect the non-existence of pages. Is that something that you can do, or know to whom a request should be made to do so?

Any chance of some further assistance here?

""""Omega and Chaos""""

In a certain mythology not known as of yet... omega and chaos are believed to be spirits of the Earth. Omega being the """"protector"""" or """"guardian"""" of Earth, and chaos being the """"armageddon"""" or """"end"""" of Earth.
Supposodely when chaos and desolence is about the Earth or is bought forth upoun the Earth Omega is awakened to balance out the excess...

And vice versa is omega awakens with the goal of sending the planet to the """"stars"""" chaos comes to balance out the excess... so there isn't really a bad guy in this situation...

Whatever  this has precisely nothing to do with the topic of """"Alpha and Omega (Christianity)"""". Go to Alpha and Omega (disambiguation) and see if anything there is relevant (if you can document your assertions, of course...)  

Omega is NOT """"protector"""" NOR """"guardian"""" of Earth, because Sampi instead really bears this function. Remember that Greek alphabet has over 30 letters. 91.94.153.30  
....this guy is just spewing from Final Fantasy VII: Dirge of Cerberus. Koromon survived intact. 

Alpha and Sampi

Full global Greek alphabet is as follows:

Α Β Γ Δ Ε Ϝ Ϛ Ζ Η Ͱ Θ Ι Κ Λ Μ Ν Ξ Ο Π Ϻ Ϸ Ϟ Ρ Σ Τ Υ Φ Χ Ψ Ω Ͳ

It begins with Alpha, and ends with Sampi. That means that Omega in this case is not final letter, because after Omega is placed too Sampi. Due to this fact, in this case God is not only local Ionian Alpha and Omega, because He is in this case too Somebody more - global Pan-Greek Alpha and Sampi. This fact should be acknowledged by all Christians that uses global Greek Alphabet, because in this case they can diminish God by excluding Him from full range of global Greek Alphabet. Ionians were justified by their unknowledge, and Jesus only adjusted Himself to their lower level of knowledge, calling Himself as local Ionian Beginning and End. Sho was placed between San and Qoppa and was only existing Greek letter not used by Greeks, but by Bactrians that adopted Greek alphabet. Comparison page is here.  

I'm sorry, but """"Sampi"""" was a kludge whereby a corrupt form of an archaic letter (formerly between Pi and Qoppa) was dragged in so that there would be 27 distinct symbols for the purposes of Isopsephy, while Sho was used in Central Asia to transcribe non-Greek languages. Neither of these symbols was ever used as a letter to write the Greek Koine language (which is the only thing which is relevant for the Bible).  

Thus that would mean that Sampi was corrupted version of San, that is placed between Pi and Qoppa.  

Probably it was (though there is still some debate over the matter). But regardless of its origin, it still was never used as a letter to write the Greek Koine language (which is the only thing that's relevant for this article).  

Because T-shaped alphabetic Sampi was introduced recently to Wikipedia, I think that it is in T-shape not corrupted, but fully fledged letter. For proof look into Sampi article to compare alphabetic T-Sampi and numeric C-Sampi. As you see, T-Sampi is more like russian П and too Greek PI, with addition of |, while C-Sampi is more like russian Э and too Greek LUNATE EPSILON, with addition of -. In this way T-Sampi should be primary, and C-Sampi secondary. CBMIBM  
It's a fully-fledged numerical symbol, but it wasn't a """"letter"""", and it's not relevant to this article.   
T-shaped Sampi was really alphabetic letter with ss value, what is stated even in Greek alphabet article in obsolete letter section, but C-shaped Sampi is mainly numerical symbol derived from previous alphabetic symbol. CBMIBM  
In other words, it was probably a medieval manuscript ligature (disigma, or sigma-sigma) identified at a late period with an archaic numerical symbol (sampi)  as was exactly the case with the medieval manuscript ligature stigma (sigma-tau) identified at a late period with an archaic numerical symbol (digamma).

Speedy deletion of Sophie hammill
 A tag has been placed on Sophie hammill requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time.

""""Not my business to go and unearth the original source documents.""""  If you read widely enough instead of relying on large overview sources and have more than a superficial interest in the subject, sooner or later you might """"unearth"""" the original documents, which are surprisingly easy to come by.  A large portion of the naval history books I have listed in my library came off the internet for nothing, and if you're lucky you'll find books which quote documents verbatim.  Last weekend I had the great pleasure to take advantage of a incompetent error made by the National Archives and was able to download a few dozen service records for free, instead of the hundreds of pounds of the five hundred pounds/thousand dollars plus I would normally have had to pay.  Already I have seen where certain historians (Gordon in The Rules of the Game is one) have obviously not checked the service record and made false assertions about certain officers, and also where they have cited the service record yet written something entirely different.

Marder is interesting because in his twenties he was possibly the last person to look at a great deal of Admiralty literature.  It's bad enough that in many cases he doesn't cite specifically the details of the correspondence involved, but it really didn't help that the Naval Historical Section literally purged untold numbers of documents, a process which was finally halted in the late fifties.  Therefore quite literally a lot of Marder's scholarship depends on his reputation and not the facts.  (talk |  | ) """,0,0,0,0,0,0

1) People like this undermine the spirit of something like Wikipedia, something that has the potential to change the way that people learn and to help everyone in society have access to all kinds of information, for free (not counting Internet access).
2) People like this have no respect for the sacrifices of our predecessors.  Without people like Jimmy Launders fighting in conflicts such as WWII, and putting their lives on the line, the ability to openly share information and to have opinions would not exist - we would live in a fully censored society, as Nazi Germany was.  So by vandalizing Launders' page, this loser shows tremendous dis-respect for the risks that were taken and the sacrifices that were made by our ancestors who put their lives on the line and in many cases made the ultimate sacrific to ensure that we could live in a world where our thoughts, ideas, and communications were not censored.  But people like Kanupur don't consider that, they only think of things selfishly.

In the UK, people often enquire about nationality not knowing themselves exactly what the Hell they mean; ask me, I've been there thousands of times. As for """"Citizenship means Nationality"""", that too is inaccurate. Citizenship is merely one form of that type of nationality (legal individual status -  the second description). There are atleast four other strands of nationality which are not citizenship; whoever acquires what is down to the circumstances. Finally, if as you say, the English language nationality means legal status, why apply it to a politician? Where is the sense in a Swedish citizen/national running affairs in Malta? Unless he were Maltese by some form of documentation, there would be a conflict of interest. And even if you can answer that one, perhaps you should check Ibrahim Rugova, remember him?

Well, my point is that Navarre (for example) has indoubtly links to the Basque Country (some parts do speak basque, some historical links...) and even have another association much related to the IRL called EUSKARA KULTUR ELKARGOA. But that doesn't mean we should link both regions in the same basket. The navarrese government has never expressed any intention of reducing its own political or social identity, the same way Andorra, Balears or Valencia haven't either. Participating in a single cultural project such as the IRL, doesn't mean that suddenly those territories have renounced to their own identities (so close or so distanct to the Catalan proper). We are not even explaining that it is just a part of the population which may be considered as catalans... We are not talking about the spanish-speakers (around 50% of all the inhabitants of these regions), the french-speakers or simply all the foreigners living for years in these territories:

Balearic Islands: 21% of the total pop. (that's 224K)
Catalonia: 15% of the total pop. (that's 1,1 million)
Valencia: 17,7% of the total pop. (that's 866K)

They sum up as 2,2 million people who don't consider themselves neither Catalan nor Valencian nor Balearic. Then, add the national population which don't speak a word of the language (2,6 million link) or even the ones who can speak it but don't use it as primary language (it roses up to around 50% of the total pop.)...

So, because of that, I keep thinking that putting ALL the inhabitants of these territories (or just the name of the regions) in the same basket is so so so """"dangerous""""...

ccae0f992866166e,"2004 Bonnie? What about Charley? 

I recall Hurricanes Bonnie and Charley hitting Florida within a day of each other, and both of them passing off the Jersey Shore a few days later.  It was the remnants of Charley, not Bonnie, which brought the heaviest rain to the Jersey Shore on August 15th, 2004. Bonnie might have spread some light rain a day or two earlier, I don't specifically remember, but Charley passed off our coast as a 40 mile per hour tropical storm. I remember this clearly because the most intense wind and rain were far ahead of Charley's center, and when the center was closest, there was no rain or wind to speak of onshore, mostly offshore. Earlier that day, Charley had been a Category One hurricane off of South Carolina, and a day or two before that, a monster Category 4, hitting Punta Gorda, Florida. Later that season, New Jersey got rains from the remnants of Frances, Gaston, Ivan & Jeanne. Jeanne was the strongest, and brought the most intense winds of that season, although Charley was far wetter. I will try to find sources to back this up, but I have followed every New Jersey tropical storm & hurricane since 1976, and work in the Office of Emergency Management. Some of the worst conditions I've ever experienced were during the passage of Tropical Storm Ernesto in 2006, because the wind and rain lasted a long, long time: about two days, with frequent gusts near hurricane force, even over that threshold just south of here..  Floyd, Bertha, Gloria and Belle were  stronger, but they moved faster. My community, Seaside Heights was in the direct center of 70 mph Tropical Storm Floyd in 1999, with a dead calm lasting about an hour, sandwiched between periods very, very wind conditions. Hanna in '08 was the biggest wimp of all these storms: a bit of rain and wind, but mostly hype.

I looked up the history of Bonnie and Charley from the National Hurricane Center.

Bonnie, http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/2004bonnie.shtml? passed east of the Jersey Shore, and probably did bring light rain, but it was not memorable

Two days later, on the 15th, Charley, http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/2004charley.shtml?  did the same, but in a much more dramatic way.

I am going to add this to the page. Thanks.

First frame of reference: Antiochus IV Epiphanes as per the Book of Daniel.

Given that many historians, critics, and many Jewish and Christian scholars believe that the Book of Daniel is about the events in Israel from the beginning of the Babylonian Captivity to the end of the Maccabean Revolt, they would say that the Old Testament reference is to Antiochus IV Epiphanes, the man who attacked the Temple in Jerusalem and defiled it by sacrificing a pig on the altar, erecting a statue of Zeus as himself in the temple, raiding the Temple treasury and minting coins saying """"Theos Epiphanes"""" (God manifest), etc.

In Revelation, John borrowed the """"Son of Perdition"""" concept from the prophecies of Daniel, relating them by language. He refers to """"the star that fell from heaven"""" by two names, one Greek, and the other Hebrew. The Greek name is """"Appolyon,"""" from the Greek root word """"apolumi."""" It refers to utter loss, eternal destruction, and disassociation."""" The Hebrew name is """"Abaddon,"""" from the Hebrew root word """"'abad,"""" which means the same thing as the Greek root word. In the Book of Daniel, the interpreter says that the eventual destiny of the """"great beast"""" is to be """"destroyed"""" ('abad), and given to the eternal flames (i.e. hell).

Second frame of reference: Judas Iscariot

In John , Jesus says that of all his disciples, none has been lost except the """"son of perdition"""". The New International Version translates the phrase as """"the one doomed to destruction.""""

 It would be useful if you dated your comments, it's much easier to follow the dates that way, rather than checking the history. I agree with Rjstott for the purpose of Wikipedia. AN, whoever you are, you are surely a person whith a scientific background. You certainly don't need this article in Wikipedia to explain the centripetal force. I wrote the following paragraph in the article:

It is important to understand right from the start that there is no 'default', 'natural' centripetal force. By default, objects tend to move in a straight line, as Newtonian mechanics teaches, away from the 'orbit', so in this context, by default there is only a centrifugal force at work. The centripetal force is being applied either by accident (meteors orbiting a planet) or artificially (satellites orbiting Earth, the object at the end of a rope etc). Therefore, the centrifugal force is a natural component of a circular movement, while the centripetal force is what we conventionally call the force keeping the object 'in orbit'.

 That paragraph has since been removed in favor of a more scientific approach. While I can agree that the statements in my explanation might have been misleading or imprecise from a scientific perspective (which is why I didn't revert the subsequent changes), I think they are a lot easier to understand by the person who needs to be explained how the centripetal/centrifugal forces work intuitively. Again, I will not fight for that paragraph, but I would like to see something easier to understand for the casual reader in the introduction.

 Let me explain what I mean with my """"intuitiveness"""" concern by using the following example: When a kid spins a rock at the end of rope he intuitively feels the centrifugal force. You will say that's not correct, he is applying the centripetal force, that's what he feels. But by that standard it would be difficult to explain gravity  following the same rationale, when you lift a suitcase you apply """"antigravity"""" to it. However, the kid will intuitively feel that he's """"beating"""" some force; when you explain that the downward force is called gravity and it's real, he's ready to accept that, although he's applying an upward force himself. People intuitively feel the force they need to """"beat"""" as the real force; the force they apply feels like the artificial part of the equation: the upward force to beat gravity is artificial, the gravity keeping the suitcase on the ground is natural. If you explain things the other way around, you confuse the casual reader. The same applies at an intuitive level with centripetal/centrifugal forces IMHO: if you start the article with an introductory statement which says that the centrifugal force doesn't really exist, that confuses the reader (""""then what's the force that I'm beating by holding on to the rope? Maybe I didn't get it right..."""") and s/he's most probably going to miss the point of the whole thing long before you get to formulas.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 More information on Lenin's partial Jewish ancestry 
The following quotes regarding Lenin's partial Jewish ancestry are from The Jewish Century by Yuri Slezkine (Princeton University Press, 2004) and could possibly be inserted in to this article in order to provide more references.

 """"But of course the most sensitive """"nationality"""" [ethnicity] of all was Lenin's. In 1924, Lenin's sister Anna discovered that their maternal grandfather, Aleksandr Dmitrievich Blank, had been born Srul (Israel), the son of Moshko Itskovich Blank, in the shtetl Starokonstantinov [Old Konstantinov] in Volynia [Volhynia, now Ukraine]. When Kamenev found out, he said, """"I've always thought so,"""" to which Bukharin allegedly replied: """"Who cares what you think? The question is, what are we going to do?"""" What """"they,"""" or rather, the Party through the Lenin Institute, did was proclaim this fact """"inappropriate for publication"""" and decree that it be """"kept secret."""" In 1932 and again in 1934, Anna Ilinichna [Lenin's sister] begged Stalin to reconsider, claiming that her discovery was, on the one hand, an important scientific confirmation of the """"exceptional ability of the Semitic tribe"""" and """"the extraordinarily beneficial influence of its blood on the offspring of mixed marriages""""; and, on the other, a potent weapon against anti-Semitism """"owing to the prestige and love that [Vladimir] Ilich [Lenin] enjoys among the masses."""" Lenin's own Jewishness, she argued, was the best proof of the accuracy of his view that the Jewish nation possessed a peculiar """"'tenacity' in struggle"""" and a highly revolutionary disposition. """"Generally speaking,"""" she concluded, """"I do not understand what reasons we, as Communists, may have for concealing this fact. Logically, this does not follow from the recognition of the full equality of all nationalities."""" Stalin's response was an order to """"keep absolutely quiet."""" Anna Ilinichna did. The enemies of the regime were deprived of additional anti-Semitic ammunition"""" (pgs. 245–246)

 """"All advanced Jews supported assimilation, according to Lenin, but it is also true that many of the """"great leaders of democracy and socialism"""" came from """"the best representatives of the Jewish world."""" Lenin himself did [have Jewish ancestry], through his maternal grandfather, although he probably did not know it. When his sister, Anna, found out, she wrote to Stalin that she was not surprised, and """"this fact"""" was """"another proof of the exceptional ability of the Semitic tribe,"""" and that Lenin had always contrasted """"what he called its 'tenacity' in struggle with the more sluggish and lackadaisical Russian character."""" (p. 163)

 """"And in 1965, all archival documents relating to Lenin's Jewish grandfather were ordered """"removed without leaving any copies."""" (pg. 338)

It is then logical that whoever holds the domain would choose not to release that information as a common sense measure. I think that the idea that ED simply wishes to """"publish all trackable personal data of victims to defame them"""" is a misunderstanding at best and a blatant lie at worst, and the point it (poorly) attempts to make is not worthy of mention in the article.

 Regarding your edits to Ellen Pompeo and Patrick Dempsey 

I have reverted your edits to these two articles. Please review WP:V to learn about appropriate, reliable sources for the information you keep adding, and also visit WP:LIBEL and WP:BLP to learn about appropriate information in biographical articles of living people. Insinuating that these two individuals are having an affair or are anything other than faithful to their respective significant others is libelous, and against Wikipedia policy. You have not provided a reliable source to support the POV suggested by your edits. WP:NPOV will help you learn about Wikipedia's neutral point of view policy.

The quotes you have added are taken out of contexttheir mentions of a """"crush"""" on each other were done in a joking manner, and another cast member followed their comments by saying she had a crush on both of thembut that's not grounds for speculating that the cast member in question is having an affair with both of them, and if I said or insinuated that she were, that would be libel. These quotes are cast members speaking highly of each other, and frankly, good public relations by supporting their on-screen chemistry and by extension, that of the fictional characters they play. Many other cast members have complimented their co-stars, including PD and EP, but no reliable source has, to my knowledge, ever published information that these two (or any other cast members) were anything other than co-stars who happen to be friends. On the contrary, both speak frequently of their significant others in high esteem (in print and on camera), and speak well of each other's partners. There's also a question of whether such compliments are even relevant in the grand scheme of the article, but that's a moot point because your edits are unsourced, and against the WP:LIBEL policy.  If you have a reliable source for your edits, in accord with WP:Verifiability, then it's a different story, but as it is, your edits are potentially libelous and not in accord with Wikipedia editing policy.

I think you have done a great job with the page, and I learned a lot from reading it and the other comments posted above.

In the toxicology studies section, I think your intention is to say that because the mouse study used very high doses of the protein and proteins that will be toxic are usually toxic at very low doses, evidence supports that the Bt toxin is not toxic to mammals.  
what I initially read, however, was just the phrase """"Research on other known toxic proteins suggests that proteins are usually toxic at low doses, further suggesting that Bt toxins are not toxic to mammals"""" which confused me by making it sound like the toxins are almost always toxic at low doses and that the Bt toxin might not be safe.

 Whoops. Nice job, kiddo. 

You said, one some poor guy's talk page:

I hope you will use this block time to consider a few matters that could make you a better editor, should you decide to continue. First, Wikipedia editors aren't nearly as stupid as you think they are. We include many people with advanced degrees who work in scholarly professions. Many of us can see through the kind of lies that you tried to use better than we can see through glass. Secondly, disruptive editing, lying, and attempts to sabotage the system not only get you into trouble, they also defeat the very goals that you are trying to achieve. If MattyBraps is deleted, one of the major reasons (but certainly not the only reason) is your behavior as creator of the article. You did serious damage to your own efforts to keep the article on Wikipedia. And finally, take some time to read Wikipedia policies. Start with WP:5P, and every time you see a blue link, click it and read what you see. If you can do these things, you might stand a chance of becoming a good editor. Otherwise, you need to move on to somewhere else to spend your time. Think about it.   

I would contend that Wikipedia editors are, in fact, as stupid as I suspect, as you still fail to grasp that the BT guy and I (the IP user you believe he sockpuppeted) are not the same person. All it took was me mirroring the way he types, pretending to be angry, and claiming """"I made the [Mattybraps] page,"""" and boom, I got him blocked. Thanks for helping me settle a bet about whether or not I could get the creator of the Mattyb wikipedia page (it's an embarrassment that it exists) banned inside of a week. I too have an advanced degree  turns out nobody gives a shit, champ. Keep up the excellent work. 75.64.190.21

This is an oooold subject/section here, but I agree, the highly detailed diagram is quite scary-looking to a novice reader, and much more complicated than the basics of the topic. Start with something simpler, since there are certainly simpler aspects of diffraction than multislit-with-vectors. File:Wave Diffraction 4Lambda Slit.png would certainly be an improvement (simpler case, still a pretty picture that clearly illustrates some key ideas). I think that diagram would be even better if the barrier/slit were actually visible clearly rather than just another thin black line in a parallel field of black lines: consider either File:Difraction.png or File:Difrakce sterbina bodova.png. Somewhat related, seems like there is no navbox for the wave-phenomena articles.

If there really are concerns about the Gibraltar government's off-hand comments about not wanting """"nasty"""" material added - which seemed quite innocent and unremarkable to me - then the concerned people should spend some time adding neutral and due weight content from guide books to some of the Gibraltar-related article. I somehow doubt there will be mass reverting of such additions, which will helpfully show that we're still getting neutral and encyclopedic content.

It's would take too long for you to go into detail about the  article creation and such. But if you could:

2. fill it with little tidbits of exclusive information so it doesn't get deleted immediately or mark it with some sort of tag that says it will shortly be updated(by me((it doesn't have to say """"by me"""" specifically but I WILL get to it as soon as you've created it and further fill it up until it is worthy of being called an article))).

I take it that your opinion is that I am (to some significant extent) disrupting Wikipedia. These points:

 Does the ongoing ANI (I haven't checked it yet) regarding canvassing, pertain? My sense is that the accusation there was satisfactorily answered, particularly by the opposing voters I was suppposed not to have notified. Will you be bringing a new ANI if I continue some particular activity (I'm not sure which, specifically), or will you block me summarily?
 I would appreciate it if you would point to specifics of what constitutes my """"ongoing disruption"""".
 I take it that you do not consider the subjects of my initial complaint (unilaterally overturning a conspicuous consensus) or the consequent rhetoric (persistant and repetitive spamming of """"reasons"""" which had all been addressed, persistant arguement ad hominem, and several insinuations that our responses are unethical or misleading, while the opposing rhetoric is self-evident) to be disruptive? Part of my defense to any accusation of campaigning would be to compile examples of the techniques of the opposition, so at least we could delineate what wiki considers unethical.

Diacritics: Moving forward

I too have no very clear idea about how to word an RfC, other than that it should be in relation to specific proposed changes to the MOS and not something vaguer. I also think it's very important to keep to the issue of diacritical marks in the original orthography of the language, and not stray into either additional letters (like eth or thorn) or the use of diacritical marks in transcription/transliteration (like retaining accents when going from πότε to póte or marking long vowels by macrons in transliterating a number of languages, including Greek and Japanese). These are separate issues.

The problems, for me, are primarily in the first paragraph of WP:DIACRITICS, which is evasive, muddled and inconsistent:
 – this is just evasion. Their use or non-use should be motivated, and hence should be encouraged or discouraged according to the strength of the motivation.
 – this encouragement to count """"hits"""" just results in muddled policy, apart from the problem of the weasel word """"general"""". However, this bit seems clear that the """"modifications"""" are to the same word, i.e. can be treated as stylistic modifications.
 This seems to me not to be consistent with the sentence before: is """"the common name"""" here supposed to be with or without the added diacritical marks? """"[V]ersions of  word"""" above should mean that """"the common """" is the same with or without the diacritical marks.
Is it possible to re-write this paragraph to achieve consensus? I don't know.   

 Agreed those are separate issuesAgreed the first quoted passage is evasive, but motivating use or avoidance of diacritics seems to be the sticking point.  Did you have some particular direction in mind?  My take has been that if reliable sources show that their use is normal for the names in question that they should be used here, except where particular subjects eschew them. E.g. for a baseball player named Eddie Sandoval we'd give him as Eddie Sándoval if some reliable sources did (it can't be based on a majority of English language sources, since majority of them ignore diacritics entirely, as a matter of editorial/publishing convenience). It's the same principle that we can cite a single source for Eddie's birth date and place even if most sources don't mention them.  A fact does not have to be provided by every single source to be considered reliable.  And it's not a matter of sources conflicting (analogous to giving two different birth dates); some giving only Sandoval without the diacritics is like some sources giving a birth year but not a full birth date; it is incomplete information, not conflicting information.  On the other hand, if Eddie himself is quoted saying he doesn't use the diacritic that should be a trumping factor (unless WP totally ditches subject preference in all areas, which seems unlikely given the number of discussions going on to make more allowances for subject preference all over the place).  This can apply to geography, too (Santa Fe, New Mexico is """"Santa Fe"""" not """"Santa Fé"""" despite the popularity of the diacritic in certain circles; the official name of both the city and the county are """"Santa Fe"""" with no accent. People frequently cite WP:OFFICIALNAME as if it were a policy, but it's actually just an essay, it may not accurately reflect the nuances in cases like this, and people often cite it without actually understanding what it says to begin with (it's frequently misinterpreted as being against use of official names, when it's really only against using them when they're directly unhelpful to readers, while otherwise we would almost certainly use the official name)I'm not sure """"general"""" in the second passage is actually a weasel word, rather than just lack of clarity.  It's not clear if it means the predominant use in reliable sources generally, the predominant use in general-audience sources, or both.  The inclusion of """"and reference works"""" strongly suggests the former.  Regardless, the """"hit-counting"""" aspect is a problem because of the aforementioned facts that a) English-language sources tend to ignore diacritics for their own conven",0,0,0,0,0,0

DELETION OR THEN MERGER 

There must be verifiable, objective evidence that the subject has received significant attention from independent sources to support a claim of notability NRV.

WP:NOPAGE -notability is a very serious question here and the weak and non-scholarly material does not amount to a stand alone article. The article is a combination of some  critic/red flagging of the  criticism of the Frankfurt School theories labelled here as """"Conspiracy Theory"""". Yes it can entertained that some  claims & rumours are discussed on minor internet sites that amount to """"Conspiracy talk"""", but it is no reason for a Wikipedia entry or let alone a stand alone Wikipedia article.

 REASONS FOR DELETION ARE NUMEROUS AND VERY CONCRETE
WP:NPOV neutral point of view! 

WP:OR -The term """"original research"""" (OR) is used on Wikipedia to refer to material—such as facts, allegations, and ideas—for which no reliable, published sources exist

WP:V - means that people reading and editing the encyclopedia can check that the information comes from a reliable source. Where available, academic and peer-reviewed publications are usually the most reliable sources, such as in history, medicine, and science.

WP:FRINGE -A theory that is not broadly supported by scholarship in its field must not be given undue weight in an article

WP:NOTOPINION -Opinion pieces, although some topics, particularly those concerning current affairs and politics, may stir passions and tempt people to """"climb soapboxes"""". 

WP:YESPOV -Avoid stating opinions as facts

WP:WEIGHT -Neutrality requires that each article or other page in the mainspace fairly represents all significant viewpoints that have been published by reliable sources, in proportion to the prominence of each viewpoint in the published, reliable sources. For example, discussion of isolated events, criticisms, or news reports about a subject may be verifiable and impartial, but still disproportionate to their overall significance to the article topic. This is a concern especially in relation to recent events that may be in the news.

If I had wanted to stuff the ballot, I could have laid in hundreds of notes to polarized user groups from random ips, instead, I spoke to 40-or-so by hand of a fairly neutral group who were directly affected by this ridiculous proposal.  

Also, citing an arbcom ruling rather than policy shows how contrived this is.  Mindspillage asked me to reconsider, he said nothing about policy or blocking. How can you say inviting participants to a Wikipedia-wide issue is disruptive?  How can you say that I should somehow have known that? The real question is, why is this thing not on the main page? The answer is, because most would oppose it, but the anti-userbox admins think they know what is best, and are pulling every trick they can to cram this through.

If you want to design either a jury-pool process or a general election process to decide such things, I'll be happy to help you.

How is this a personal attack, except to note that the mass blanking happened and the perpetrator is documented?  Face it, the ban came only because what I said is unpopular with admins. MarkSweep made hundreds of blanking edits using admin tools, speciously twisted rules into knots and disrupted hundreds of users. He got a slap on the wrist, and polite applause.  I've received notes from admins on this page threatening me for suggesting that his actions constitute vandalism, which they clearly do.  I pass a note pointing this out to a small subset of the hundreds of users affected, I am banned for 31 hours.  How is this not political? Now I'm afraid to contact my own friends here, whom I know to be against this, but do not know about it.

Tacky? Pretending this proposal is put before a representative audience is tacky, as is the slash-and-burn approach taken in the first place, as is the attempts by MarkSweep to fit me with a gag until the end of UPP (that is REALLY tacky), as is the naked political calculation on my AN/I as to how this speaks for their pet proposal, and how it should be played.

Listen: there were 350,000 Germans in Vojvodina before the war, and about 250,000 of them left from the region together with the withdrawal German army, before partisans took control of the region. The remaining 100,000 were the subject for persecution. Also, it is not quite correct that those 250,000 fled the partisans, but they fled the Soviet Red Army. Partisans came after Red Army (or together with it at least). Also, it is the main difference between Germans and Jews, since most of the Jews were killed or deported during the war, while most of the Germans escaped before they could became a subject for persecutions. Second thing, during the war, Serbs also were persecuted and thousands of them were held in prison camps or expelled. The only difference between Germans and Serbs here is that Serbs returned to their homes after the war, and Germans did not. So, is that difference a good reason to write here only about persecuted Germans and not about persecuted Serbs too? It is good that you said that the one who want to know who were partisans should to read the """"Partisans"""" article, because the one who want to know more why Germans fled should to read Danube Swabians article. However, the kind of compromise I would accept would be to write that most of the Germans colaborated with German troops during the war, and that this was a reason why partisans persecuted them.

Not necessarily.  I believe SD 2.0 has tighter electrical specifications than SD 1.x (such as lower voltage tolerances and higher current tolerances) so a SD 1.x device may, but would not necessarily, qualify as an SD 2.0 device.  It would need to be meet the electrical specs of SD 2.0 before it could be able to offically support SDHC and carry the SDHC logo.  It is possible that some SD 1.x devices will already meet this spec just because they were designed well from the start, but they would need to be tested to ensure they meet the SD 2.0 electrical spec and also have a firmware upgrade.  136.186.1.185  04:08, 1 July 2008",0,0,0,0,0,0

Male graduates before 1969 
I've added mention to the 'trivia' section regarding men who matriculated at vassar immediately after world war II on the GI bill. I suppose this could be classified as 'original research', not sure. My father was in that first graduating class that included men (eleven of them). A scan of the relevant portion of the program from the graduation ceremonies can be found here . again, if this constitutes original research, i guess it can be pulled, though it is a rather fascinating bit of history.  

 Bias 

There are many abundantly clear examples of bias in this article: “Vassar is often praised for its beautiful campus, a 1000 acre (4 km?) lot of land marked by period and modern buildings that is also an arboretum; since that time, it has maintained its reputation as one of America's outstanding liberal arts colleges, and is especially noted for its tolerant social atmosphere; the college is a member of the """"Little Ivies,"""" an unaffiliated group of elite northeastern liberal arts colleges; Vassar is a leader in producing doctoral candidates; Vassar students are well known for their individuality, creativity, and open-mindedness; many beautiful old brick buildings are scattered throughout the bucolic campus, but there are also several modern and contemporary structures worth noting.""""  Did this come straight from the College’s website?   

 Bias ? 

I disagree with the above allegation of bias in the article.  I found no similarity between the Vassar Web site and the article.  The information in question - the attractiveness of the campus - seems fairly innocuous and is fairly similar to the type of information in Wikipedia articles about other liberal arts colleges and several universities.  The article reads like synopsis of commercially available background information in colleges guide books.  While I would have written the main paragraph differently, I hardly think this qualifies as biased, and without some criteria to differentiate this page from other pages on other schools, I believe the objection should be removed from this page.

The article violates Wikipedia's NPOV policy, clearly.  Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, a place to find innformation, not a forum for opinions.  If you are unwilling to make changes, then I will go ahead and make them myself.  Also, you should leave you name when commenting.   

Also, I realize that the article is not up to date and violates Wikipedia's policy against personal research (ie, students spend time doing ceratin activities on a certain lawn).   

I do agree that much of the information on this page is somewhat biased. And the architectural info came from me, not the college's website - so, my apologies for lack of """"neutrality"""" there. However, if you edit the page to remove said """"bias"""", please re-read your edits before saving the page. Simply removing phrases and not doing a little copyedit makes the page read poorly. I have made some minor edits just so that it reads a little cleaner, hopefully not restoring anything that you feel is biased. I think the bigger issue is that this page has become a series of lists (academic majors, famous alums, residence halls) with little encyclopedic content and is an embarrasment compared to other articles about comparable schools. Someone please help to fix this article!  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

jftr, what the above refers to

Former MPs do have working links in Parliament. If you weren't so eager to smash things rather than fix them, you would have noticed that. And you couldn't even be bothered to let me know there might be a problem. I hope our paths never cross again but I suppose I'll have to watch your contributions in future to make sure you aren't deleting everything I do. What a waste of time. Oh yeah - I'll assume you were smashing in good faith. As if. Thanks for ruining my (formerly) good mood, as I was enjoying making some useful contributions to Wikipedia articles.   
Welcome to Wikipedia. Now, a recap. With this edit you added a link to the current MPs list, for Carter. Problem was it was for David Carter, not John Carter so I removed it. I went to replace it with one for John Carter, but there is none, so I couldn't. You then added another link, but like the first one it too went to the wrong person, this time, Cam Calder. I removed it with the edit summary """"Cannot replace it because Carter is no longer an mp"""". You have responded by inserting a brand new link to Former MPs. I was unaware Carter has been added to that list, but that is beside the point because I was removing links to current MPs. If you intend to edit Wikipedia for a while I suggest you don't shout in your edit summaries as you did with """"Former MPs DO HAVE WORKING LINKS. Wikipedians fix links rather than delete them"""",  and you address the actual issue and don't jump to conclusions.   
Not true! The actual issue was that you deleted ALL the links I added for him. That is the recap. The two other links worked fine, but you deleted them as well in your hurry to smash everything someone else did. In other words, you are the one who jumped to conclusions. Now you're trying to claim you only deleted the one that was a problem. Even your edit summary is wrong. The man's resignation was presented the same day I was adding the links, unknown to me, so it seems the Parliament link was being moved from current to former which caused pointer problems when I clicked on it. Things happen. It only needed to be fixed. I would have thought an Admin would be capable of figuring that out. Nor could you figure out how to leave a message on my Talk page so I could figure it out. You just couldn't wait to smash everything. I only came back to the article because I was going through the non-Cabinet people on the list. Did you fix that list, once you realized this was a former MP? No, you did not. That would have been """"work"""", requiring """"thought"""" and """"effort"""". Same as you mis-corrected the hat note on the other John Carter MP. Based on your arrogance, I thought it likely you were an Admin. What a surprise, I was right. And Jimbo wonders why the numbers of actual contributors are going straight downhill. I have NO intention of continuing to contribute to Wikipedia because you obviously would prefer to do everything yourself. You're not at all welcoming, helpful, polite, assuming good faith, or anything else I was led to believe is part of the Wikipedia ethos. So I leave you to it. You didn't even have the grace to apologize for deleting the other links, you just tried to blame me in this audit trail. Go lecture someone else, because I'm out of here, and you can be sure I won't be encouraging anyone else to participate in what could have been a good project. Your attitude is horrendous, and I'm sure I'm not the first one you've chased out of here. Well, keep it up and you'll soon have the whole thing to yourself. Enjoy.

 """"TMTCFY""""? new """"Dashes"""" section & """"memorable""""  

I'm delighted to see the new """"Dashes"""" section progressing (it appears) in the approval/adoption process.

In your reply to one of A. di M.'s posts in the subsequent discussion, you used the abbreviation """"TMTCFY"""".  A search of 4 major online dictionaries of abbreviations, plus both a WP and a Google search, yielded no explanation of it, and I couldn't figure it out from the context. Am I missing something?  (I'm not particularly fluent in that argot.)

Finally, in the section """"Features of the Draft"""" of your """"Preliminary Notes"""", you said, """"...  the principles themselves are simple and memorable.""""  Memorable?  MWC11 defines memorable as, """"worth remembering   NOTABLE .""""  Although these rules might be """"worth remembering"""" in one sense, I don't think they rise to the standard MWC11 intended, which IMO implies something of considerably greater significance.  E.g., the day you were born was probably a memorable day to your mother; """"To be or not to be, that is the question ..."""" is one of the most memorable lines in all of English-language literature; but 
""""an en dash is not used for a hyphenated personal name""""?  Umm, not so much.  It's simply of a different ilk altogether.  (I'm not sure principles was the right word to use, either.  Aren't they just rules?  Or rationales for those rules?  But I'll let that one slide for now.  My prior quibble is sufficient unto the day.)

A simple review of the templates would have shown that any alleged accessibility problems would need to be dealt with by a change in the behaviour of class=""""abbr"""" in MediaWiki, and are therefore not a topic for discussion here. That the nominator did not conduct the most simple research before nominating these templates for deletion is shown here: the fact that the TfD notice was not included within  tags led to the disruption of over 5000 articles, something which the nominator could have prevented had he thought to used simple discussion before even contemplating bringing the matter here. The disruption was completely predictable, given that the nominator chose to nominate more than 200 templates at once. The speedy keep does not imply any judgment on the accessibility questions raised in the discussion, which should be addressed in more appropriate fora.  (talk) 
I have no objection to this being closed as keep, as there was consensus in that direction; but that was a provocative and insulting closure notice.
Firstly, it seems you're yet another person who has never actually bothered to read Wikipedia:Speedy keep, as your reasons for speedy keeping are at odds with what is written there. Secondly, it is not at all clear why TFD is not the place to discuss a vast collection of templates whose only purpose is a gimmick that breaks web accessibility. Thirdly, the whole point of the  template is for it to be transcluded with the template, in order to advertise the discussion. If I had noincluded it, I might well have been accused of trying to hide the discussion. Therefore your suggestion that I """"did not conduct the most simple research"""" is a great steaming load of crap.
It is pretty obvious from the hostile tone of your response, together with the fact that you're deeply involved in chemistry articles, that you didn't like the nomination, and decided to speedy close the discussion instead of just saying your piece and waiting for an unbiased closure.

""""BENGHAZI, Libya (AP) — Moammar Gadhafi loyalists seized control of a Libyan city and raised the ousted regime's green flag, an official and military commanders said Tuesday, in the most serious revolt yet against the country's government.

The retaking of Bani Walid highlights the vulnerability of Libya's new leaders, who have faced mounting criticism as they struggle to unify the oil-rich North African nations and build state institutions from scratch three months after Gadhafi was captured and killed.

The seizure also appeared to be the first major, organized operation by armed remnants of Gadhafi's regime, adding to the security woes of the ruling National Transitional Council. The council has so far made little progress in unifying armed forces. Instead it is left reliant on multiple """"revolutionary brigades,"""" militias made up of citizens-turned-fighters, usually all from a specific city or even neighborhood.

The militias were created during the months of civil war against Gadhafi's forces last year and when the war ended in October, the various brigades remain in control of security affairs of each city they liberated. Though loyal to the NTC, they have also feuded among themselves and acted on their own initiative, and the council has been unable to control them.

Hundreds of well-equipped and highly trained remnants of Gadhafi's forces battled for eight hours in Bani Walid with the local revolutionary brigade, known as the May 28 Brigade, which was eventually driven out, said Mubarak al-Fatmani, the head of Bani Walid local council. The Gadhafi loyalists then raised the green flag over buildings in the western city.

On Monday's attack, he said four revolutionary fighters were killed and 25 others were wounded.

The revolutionary brigade had kept only a superficial control over the mountain city, a longtime Gadhafi stronghold which was one of the last to fall to NTC rule late last year.""""The only link between Bani Walid and the revolution was May 28, now it is gone and 99 percent of Bani Walid people are Gadhafi loyalists,"""" said the head of Bani Walid's military council, Abdullah al-Khazmi, confirming the fall of the city. He spoke to The Associated Press at a position on the eastern outskirts of Bani Walid, where hundreds of pro-NTC reinforcements from Benghazi were deployed, with convoys of cars mounted with machine guns.

A top commander of a revolutionary brigade in Bani Walid, Ali al-Fatmani, who was present in Benghazi during the attack, says he has lost contact with other fighters in the town.The three officials said the attackers belong to Brigade 93, a militia newly created by Gadhafi loyalists who reassembled after the fall of the regime. The fighters, flush with cash and heavy weaponry including incendiary bombs, have been increasing in power in the city, they said.

'''A month ago, Gadhafi loyalists attacked another revolutionary brigade from Tripoli that entered Bani Walid, killing 13, said al-Fatmani.""""

Assume Good Faith Does Not Mean Have Blind Faith Despite the Facts

By repeatedly  for months  citing a book published by St. Martin's Press (New York), """"Feeling Your Pain,"""" as a source of chapter-long damning criticism of the National Civilian Community Corps, LoverOfArt was abusing the name of a respected publishing house and misleading Wikipedia readers.

That St. Martin's Press would publish a book does not of course imply that no competing or contradictory facts exist.  But it does imply that the information has survived a responsible vetting process by fact checkers and lawyers.

(By the way, according to the flap copy of the book,""""Feeling Your Pain,"""" (at least as published in hardcover by St. Martin's Press, 2000), the writing of the author, Bovard, """"has been denounced by FBI Director Louis Freeh, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, the White House AIDS czar, as well as by the Chiefs of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the U.S. International Trade Commission."""")

As is now clear, """"Feeling Your Pain"""" does not even mention NCCC or the National Civilian Community Corps (except in the footnotes, referring to one speech by then-President Clinton  not exactly a source of documented criticism of a program he signed into law), in a chapter devoted to what was then 50,000 members of AmeriCorps, not the 1100+ Corps Members of NCCC.

So to Dbiel and Che Nuevara: It took a lot to get me to sound off about LoverOfArt. I responded calmly to his repeated rants about me, saying I was foaming at the mouth, my writing was Lunacy, fluff, and similar crap.  At this point his """"editing"""" of the National Civilian Community Corps has been conclusively demonstrated as biased and maliciously distorted:  his doctoring of quotes into misleading criticisms of the National Civilian Community Corps (quoting NCCC as having been labeled a """"fraud"""" in an article he cites that does not mention NCCC) should disqualify him from being part of this group.

When I read what he wrote and posted at Wikipedia, quoting the author of Feeling Your Pain as calling NCCC a """"fraud"""" in an article he cites (untrue), saying the author devoted an entire chapter of his book to criticism of NCCC (untrue)  in a book published by St. Martin's Press, even I started to doubt the litany of glowing reports from credible and verifiable sources that I had read about this organization.

Someone unfamiliar with positive reports about NCCC would have been even more likely to greet news of the demise of NCCC - something ardently sought recently by persons using the same kinds of arguments LoverofArt posted  with detachment, if not pleasure.

That his statements  quotes  about NCCC are now known to be false and misleading means that he no longer enjoys an assumption of Good Faith.

So I would like you to spare me your lectures about my supposed sins. """"No information is better than misleading information,"""" as Jimbo Wales liked to say. LoverOfArt has no business mauling the content of this page, nor does Wikipedia have any business disseminating his posts.

I am perfectly ready and willing to work respectfully and cooperatively with any editor who has not used the vicious and underhanded methods that LoverofArt has resorted to.

I have shown a willingness to respond to your editorial concerns. Dbiel wanted more notable sources. I posted a number of them quickly, including citations from the Baltimore Sun, the NY TImes, The Washington Times, and an Arizona newspaper - news outlets reflecting a spectrum of points of view.  (LoverofArt discounted all of the Baltimore Sun citations, saying none were notable.)

I don't maintain that my copy (or my view of what should be at the NCCC page) is perfect or unassailable or that other's work has no place. I have labeled some posts """"suggested edits.""""  I have no problem with honest content that is in context that runs counter to my perspective.

But LoverofArt is clearly willing to resort to dishonest (or at the very least, grossly misleading) editing to ensure that his view prevails.  My editing reflects my perspective, but it  is not dishonest:  I present information that is verifiable and accurate, to the best of my ability.  If I make a mistake, and I sometimes do, I try to correct it, and I would welcome the correction of others - I do not want to be have a part in disseminating inaccurate or misleading information.  

I left LoverofArt's Criticisms page on the NCCC article for a long time, until I could verify whether or not it was accurate.  That is the mark of responsible editing.

 Actually a Subculture? 

I've seen at least a couple arguments over whether or not """"emo"""" is a discernible modern genre or subculture, of if it's merely a pejorative term, a sort of made-up scapegoat genre and subculture. Of course none of this come from credible sources. Do we have any? Has anyone else heard anything similar? 128.186.230.124  

I don't completely understand what you just said or asked, but yes we have sources that call it a subculture. Just not the """"right"""" sources appairintly (sorry I spelled that wrong).   

Emo is a genre of music. Some sources lacking authority and/or reliability call it a """"subculture"""" - but many of them also make some interesting claims (e.g. """"Emos worship death"""" - certainly, such religious beliefs may help set them apart as a subculture, but this is of course totally untrue and nonsense).   

I've only seen one source that has said they worship death, and that source was complete crap anyway. Second, some of the sources are certainly reliable they just lack authority which is what we need but also what we don't have so nothing can be done(boo bad sources). Oh, and Emo is a Subgenre of music (LOL, yeah, I know, I'm being needlesly picky about what Emo is and what Emo is not but still it is a Subgenre of music). IMO, Emo is a Subculture but my oppinion is completely worthless as far as wikipedia is concerned. I'm not a good source, none of us are (LOL).   

If they are known to misuse the word then that would make them unreliable. """"Emos worship death"""" is just one of a number of contentious claims that leads unlearned sources to the false idea that it is any more than a genre of music. neonwhite   talk 

Course it would, but I would like to know how all of them misuse """"Subculture."""" Yes I do reliase your alluding to the MSN source (at least that's how I see it) but I'd still like to know. Also, any source that says we worship death would probably be BS, no? So far that is the only contentious statement that I'm seeing. BTW, it is more than a form of music, we just don't have the sources that say it, so those of us who want it to be more on wikipedia can't do anything, oh well.   

There is no evidence that it represents anything other than a genre of music that is why 'subculture' is misused. We can't have an article about a subculture that no-one has defined regardless of whether a media sources uses the term. It would be a one sentence article. neonwhite   talk

Clearly, DZ, you're as well read on Biblical scholarship as I am. While I respect your learning, I must point out that the historicity of Esther is interesting, but tangential to this discussion. The article specifies texts """"referenced by, but not found in, the Bible."""" Whether anyone finds Esther ahistorical doesn't impact the fact that Esther is part of the Bible, and therefore, books described therein qualify for this article.

To pick over the list with esoteric debates about whether any or all of the bible is ahistorical is probably a worthwhile article, but the discussion doesn't go HERE. This article has a simple definition: If the reference is in the Tanakh, the reference belongs on the list.

 Definitions of Beat vs. No such thing as a """"Beat"""" artist, Round 2: The Formal Argument Edition! 

Now let's get down to some actual business. Formal argument is necessary because this argument has degenerated so far (by me, mostly, just for fun). I'll break it down piece by piece so it's easier to digest for people unwilling to read what others are saying:

Purpose of this argument: To fix a very serious problem with structure, clarity, and reader friendliness inherent in this page and in the topic as a whole. The problem is that the term """"Beat Generation"""" is used in multiple ways to the degree that it becomes confusing for the general reader and leads to arguments about who """"is"""" and """"isn't"""" a """"beat.""""

Proposal: We should fix the structure of the page 

Ginsberg Deliberate Prose:
""""The phrase 'beat generation' rose out of a specific conversation with Jack Kerouac and John Clellon Holmes around '50-51 when, discussing the nature of generations recollecting the glamour of the lost generation, Kerouac said, Ah, this is nothing but a beat generation ... not meaning to name the generation but to un-name it.""""

He discusses the origin of the term """"beat"""" in """"hip language"""" froom Huncke and then discusses how it became associated with """"beatific"""" in 1959 (and on a side note, that reinforces Doom's side of a previous disagreement, though Ginsberg says """"articulated"""" which could mean it was conceived of earlier).

""""A fourth meaning accumulated, that of the 'beat generation literary movement.' This was a group of friends who had worked together on peotry, prose and cultural conscience from the mid-forties until the term became popular natuionally in the late fifties. The group consisting of Kerouac ... Neal Cassady, William Burroughs ... Herbert Huncke, John Clellon Homes ... Allen Ginsberg, myself; we met Carl Solomon and Philip Lamantia in '48; encountered Gregory Corso in 1950, and we first saw Peter Orlovsky in 1954.

""""By the mid-fifties this smaller circle, through natural affinity of modes of thought or literary style or planetary perspective was augmented in friendship and literary endeavor by a number of writers in San Francisco, including Michael McClure, Gary Snyder, Philip Whalen and a number of other powerful but lesser-known poets such as Jack Micheline, Ray Bremser, and ... LeRoi Jones  all of whom accepted the term at one time or another, humorously or seriously, but sympathetically, and were included in a survey of bet general manners, morals, and literature by Life magazine in a lead article in the late '50s by one Paul O'Neill, and by the journalist Alfred Aronowitz in a large series on the Beat Generation in the New York Post.

""""By the mid-fifties a sense of some mutual trust and interest was developed with Frank O'Hara and Kenneth Koch, as well as with Robert Creeley and other alumni of Black Mountain ...

""""The fifth meaning of the phrase 'Beat Generation' is the influence of the literary and artistic activities of poets, filmmakers, painters, writers and novelists who were working in concert in anthologies, publishing houses, independent filmmaking, and other media. Some effects of the aforementioned groups refreshed the bohemian culture which was already a long tradition (in film and still photography, Robert Frank and Alfred Leslie; in music, david Amram; in painting, Larry Rivers; in poetry publishing, Don Allen, Barney Rosset, and Lawrence Ferlinghetti) extended to fellow artists such as Susan Sontag and Norman Mailer."""" etc.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Reasons for removal:

 Abu Huraira is one of the most prolific muhaddithin and a source of many of the sahih hadith.

 """"sad examples of what happens"""" <- that's a non-NPOV (non-Neutral Point Of View)

d5af077462f356d7,""":::* I'm not using jabs or insults of any kind.  """"Greek-centric"""" means """"centered on Greece or concerns relating thereto"""". That's an accurate description of the view that things relating to Greece use words (in English) derived from Greek-language Hellas on the basis that Greeks themselves prefer this term. If this were a discussion about Germans wanting everything about Germany to use Deutsche in English too, that would be a German-centric concern (i.a. a concern centered on Germany, Germans, and their preferences).  NB: I actually know Germans who insist that we should stop saying """"German"""" and """"Germany"""" (and that the Spanish should stop using Alemán), and everyone use """"Deutsche"""" and """"Deutschland"""", so, no, it is not a red herring fallacy at all, but a comparison chosen carefully (though not carefully enough; see a bit later). Your own counter however, is a straw man fallacy; no one said anything about transliterating vs. not transliterating, so the """"Ελλάς"""" argument is a complete non sequitur.  I do agree that Hellenic is an English word, and concede the point that the Deutsche comparison wasn't very apt after all; I was focused more on the situational than linguistic similarity when I chose it.  A better example would be expecting our articles about Japan and the Japanese to use Nippon and Nipponese to better match the native name of the country; these are in fact words in English. It would actually make  sense to do that than to do what's been proposed here, because """"Nipponese"""" has no confusing alternative meaning, unlike """"Hellenic"""" which commonly, probably  commonly, refers to ancient Greek culture in English, not modern.  —  ☏ ¢ ≽ʌⱷ҅ᴥⱷʌ≼

d5ebccb1986ff619,"Mary Ambrose was not Robert Palmer's girlfriend at the time of his death, although they had been involved in a casual relationship. However, during the time period that Mary Ambrose was involved with Robert Palmer, she was involved with a number of men, even having two children, in 2001 and 2002, with men known to Robert Palmer. Mary Ambrose's son born in 2001 was fathered by Mick Carter, who was Robert Palmer's manager, until Palmer fired him in the second week of September. Unfortunately, since Mick Carter was the first person to discover that Robert Palmer had died, he took the opportunity to lie to the press on a number of points, including naming Mary Ambrose as Robert Palmer's girlfriend. Robert Palmer was no longer involved with Mary Ambrose before his death. His only contact with her at that point was trying to iron out a settlement agreement with Ambrose ensuring that she would not give interviews about him, or discuss him with the press. Mick Carter was not fond of Robert's true girlfriend, in fact he disliked her intently. Robert Palmer hadn't told many people about Mick Carter's firing, opting to complete his publicity appearances in Paris for Drive before doing so. Carter was fully aware of this, and took advantage of the situation. When it was discovered what he had done, and the surfeit of bogus and incorrect information that he had provided to the press worldwide, the information was invalidated due to his firing and credibility issues. Because of his close friendship with Mary Ambrose, he saw a money making opportunity for them in Robert Palmer's death. Carter even went so far as to stage a 'hoax' interview on Mary Ambrose's behalf, entitled Robert Palmer Was Addicted To My Love. The article appeared on the 28th of September, two days after the death of Palmer. The interview allegedly took place by phone, backed up by a signed release. When the interview was challenged by the family as being false, the interview was basically Robert Palmer emoting about Mary Ambrose, who his children knew he was no longer involved with in any vernacular at the time of his death, the article was revealed to be a hoax. At the time Robert Palmer was allegedly giving this interview by phone, he was in fact in attendance at a social function accompanied by three friends of his, who vouched he was with them the entire time the interview was allegedly taking place. As for the release, it was proven that Robert Palmer's signature was forged, and not a very good forgery at that. The article was to appear in three parts, but once the publishers realized that the article was a hoax, they cancelled the publication of the other two parts of the article and invalidated the one part that they had ran.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Daniel Vincent Kelley's Theory regarding this phrase
First I want to point out that while it is CLAIMED in the article that Marie Antoinette was kind and noble and gracious of the peasants, NOTHING is cited to prove such. The one Antoinette quote that is offered to this end, smacks of sociopathology or her recognition that she would promote her OWN cause, by offering kindness to those who are proving themselves kind to her. There's nothing in the phrase to indicate that she was speaking of the whole of the French people, but it seems she was speaking about some particular people who had been particularly kind to her. Calculating psychopaths can be kind for this reason, so that they will enjoy camaraderie with their aids. So, this statement, that she felt she should be nice to the people who were being nice to her, certainly does NOT certify Marie Antoinette as kind hearted or noble. I suspect, that much as the phrase is thrown around today, it was probably thrown around by the clique of it's originator. They probably had a real laugh, suggesting things the peasants could eat, when they ran out of bread as happened under the leadership of every dictatorial monarchy. Here's how I imagine the phrase came to be said by Marie Antoinette is she heard her royal family, her mom and dad and step parents, maybe her grandparents, talking about what had been said in an age past, when the peasants ran out of food and started eying the national leadership as cause. Then, when she found herself in the situation, she used what was in her circle a cliche, that was widely unknown to the rest of the world. She probably didn't think much of saying it, she probably thought it would be received by her audience as cute and figured it would never get around, never become more widely known that she said it AND probably she hadn't really considered how callous it is when people are starving, to make light of it. So, my guess, is that, EXACTLY as the phrase is thrown around today for it being so pithy and the situation so often endured, peasants starving, Marie-Thérèse originated it, the phrase circulated amongst Royalty for 100 years, probably spoken of at dinner parties how pithy was Marie-Thérèse, how callous and witty and devilishly fun (from the sadistic royal perspective). So Marie-Thérèse originates it, Marie Antoinette's family speaks of it, tells the story. Marie Antoinette happens upon the same situation, bread shortage, she rehashes the phrase originated by Marie-Thérèse. Rouseau writing of it, attributing it to a Princess who he had not heard first hand say it, proves that the phrase was circulating in royal and educated circles. He says some earlier royal said it, presumably she said it to other royals and presumably Rouseau similarly heard it spoken by royals. So, obviously, if Marie-Thérèse said it, 100 years before Rouseau wrote it, obviously the phrase was conveyed by some royal story teller, who probably blathered on and on about all the corruption and hi-jinks those callous witty royals do, for love of reliving the old times and as """"lessons"""" to the young royals on how to live. Marie Antoinette saying it, in royal company, would be like her saying, I'm on your side royal friends. It's basically a slightly witty way for Marie Antoinette to say she doesn't care how the peasants get through their hard times, how the royals deal with the peasants through those hard times, callous, is her intent and plan. It was a way of declaring her loyalty and making light of the situation. Many here have claimed that because Rouseau wrote it before Antoinette could possibly have said it, means that Antoinette never said it. That's OBVIOUSLY nonsense. She OBVIOUSLY didn't originate the phrase, credit Marie-Thérèse, but that wouldn't prevent her from spouting cliche as so many nim wits make habit.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

 US emissions description is totally contentless now. 

The US section is total nihil. It is nothing more than a circular self-referencing system of cryptic abbreviations, without absolutely any kind of numerical data to back it up! I guess you do not understand? Well, based on the wikipedia info a US """"partial zero emissions vehicle"""" could either be a bicycle (where the only emission is the cyclist's fart, to be rude) or a modified Hummer H1 SUV having an 1000 bhp Kenworth truck engine. There is no numerical info on the page to let us decide which is the case.

Any person could create a system of circularly self-referencing acronyms and abbreviations for emissions categories out of thin air. Yet, it would still be zero information content. So either delete the US emissions section or add the numerical data (how many grams of CO2, NOx, SOx, unburnt fuel, particle charcoal matter are emitted per distance travelled) to back up those cryptic PZEV and alike codes with verifieable information.

Look at the Euro-X standard descriptions. Each one is just a single sentence and it tells us the truth frankly. Weight and numbers, nothing else matters. Acronyms are PR bullshit and do not belong to an ecyclopaedia.

It is a shame US people do not dare to face the polluting nature of their monster cars and try to hide the sad """"20mpg"""" reality behind cryptic PZEV and similar abbreviations. In Europe 65mpg is reality now.

And you are just about as rude; the insipid argument of """"300"""" finding justification (If not outrightly an excuse) by being based on the """"Spartan"""" point of view (Which is simplistic and trivialized to say the least) being inherently biased to the degree of promoting obvious fascism and racism and thus finding a market and an audience willing to pay to be entertained by such media reveals a level of idiocy where basically any untruth or case of defamation could be peddled by the same stupid rationale.

I for one think the Greeks have had one of their great patriotic moments unjustly marketed to ignorant teenagers, like a cheap McDonald's burger. And worse, the Persians were outrightly denied their humanity. Let's for one second assume that the point-of-view indeed is """"Spartan"""". So what? If the purported """"Spartan"""" point-of-view is perverse, biased, untruthful, racist (If not outrighly inhuman considering a great deal of Persians in the film were depicted in a number of bizarre ways that would rather go under the sub-human category) and full of flaws... Why the fuck invest over 60 million dollars in a Hollywood production and try to find a market and an audience to bolster this bizarre concept? It just goes to show that profit is made on someone else's expense, while everything could legally be peddled as """"art"""" or """"entertainment"""" while making a buck out of it. Seems like the perfect backdoor in avoiding charges of libel and defamation.

In fact, how about someone makes a collage of Zack Snyder and Frank Miller in photoshopped pictures performing fellatio and label it art? Libel, anyone? Defamation? If art is free, then certainly the wind may and must blow in all directions, just as much as a coin may have two sides. After all, through the argument of """"point of view"""", anything could be distributed as art. And why stop there? A sequel entailing their mothers could be appropriate, considering that the new best friends Snyder and Miller have confirmed a sequel.

We need to maintain the original version till the dispute is resolved. Anonymous edits and partial reverting will only lead to more confusions. If people continue to edit, I propose to remove all caste names from the article till the dispute is resolved.   

Sorry, I thought that I had fully reverted the ip. Anyway, I've read all the English items, in some cases more than once.I can see that the Gounder community phrase is used in the sense of meaning the KV community, but that is only apparent if there is a """"hook"""" in the article to give it some context. Eg: an article talks abour the KMK, you know that KMK = KV, and so when it then says """"Gounder community"""" then the context makes it is obvious that they mean KV. I've not explained that particularly well, but short version: yes, in the examples Gounder community = KV.

The problem is, that is not good enough. You cannot prove that the term is not used to refer to other groups of Gounder than the KV, nor could I find a really clear-cut example among the English language sources: all of them demanded that the reader already knew some background - eg: that KMK = KV party. Sure, you know that but someone born & bred in the UK or USA, Germany or Guatemala, Australia and Austria most probably will not. In that sense, you are engaging in synthesis, and we are not allowed to do that here.

You said that the Tamil sources were important. Are they really going to resolve the issues that I raise? In particular, is even one of them going to explicitly say that the term is used either """"always"""" or """"most frequently"""" to refer to KVs? -   

, none of them will say, Gounder """"always"""" refers to KVs because there are other communities too that are using the title. But you need to view from another angle. Why other communities (non-Kvs) are not referred as just Gounder Community ? Because, all the sections of Vettuvars, Vanniyars, Vokkaligas don't use Gounder title. Only some sections of those communities use the title and hence they cannot be generally referred as Gounder community. This gives the freedom to refer KVs as Gounder community. 

""""All of them demanded that the reader already knew some background - eg: that KMK = KV party"""". This is not very difficult. We can attach this reference along with other references to prove that KMK or KMP = KV party. Anyway, if this not enough, here is another reference which says about Gounder community (taken from Deccan Chronicle). Persons belonging to Kongu Vellalar are mentioned as persons from Gounder Community.To prove that, Gounder community mentioned here refers to Kongu Vellalar, I have attached the proof here. which says Sengottaiyan is a Kongu Vellalar. No need to infer from KMP or KMK. This reference will directly establish that Gounder Community mentioned refers to Kongu Vellalar. [[User:Mahevenki|Mahevenki",0,0,0,0,0,0

Eric's got form for this sort of thing - if he gets it into his head you're a wrong'un, no amount of evidence or explanations as to how you've never acted against him, had any crossed words with him, or how you actually even like him, will make any difference to him. Although possibly aggravated by his well renowned poor memory for the names of other editors he interacts with, as you saw when you corrected him about his claim you always start ANI threads, he just ignored you and instead upped the ante, referring to your """"obvious campaign of harassment"""" of him. A clear personal attack if ever there was one. He's done it with this 'reformed' account many times already, he did it when he was socking on his 'roommate' account, and he did it when he was just plain old Malleus the b/tard. It's ironic this behaviour is the same sort of bullying he often accused admins of doing. And with no hint of irony at all from him, he accused you of trying to demean and patronise him, even though that's basically how he treats anyone on Wikipedia he doesn't agree with. Still, as you see, nobody cared, due to the fact he gets special protection from the likes of Drmies.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Richard Frye]: """"Although the Tura in the Avestan Age were most probably Iranian, perhaps the memory of the struggles with aborigines played a part in the development of the epic.  Later, of course, the Turks conveniently took the role of the great enemies of Iran.  The extent of the influence of the Iranian epic is shown by the Turks who accepted it as their own history as well as that of Iran.  The Turks were so much influenced by this cycle of stories that in the eleventh century AD we find the Qarakhanid dynasty in Central Asia calling itself the 'family of Afrasiyab' and so it is known in the Islamic history”(R.N.

Article needs review by nuclear physicist(s)
Just skimming the introduction I found three rather significant factual errors which I corrected.  I review those here.

The first point was that the article insisted that fusion occurs between like-charged atomic nuclei, but this limitation is not true.  For example, a nuclear reaction of 12C+16O can proceed through the fusion channel, yet their atomic charge differs.  There are literally hundreds of such cases, and citation would be gregarious and seems unnecessary (but I can link a few articles if anyone disputes this point).

The article suggested that two protons can fuse, and even suggested that such a reaction is governed by the nuclear strong force.  Not true.  p+p->d is a weak interaction, because you must convert a proton into a neutron.  Weak interactions are not fusion.

This error leads to a more general point.  Simply putting nuclei together to make something heavier does not constitute fusion.  A common misconception is that nuclear fusion refers to any coalescence of nuclei, but in nuclear physics, fusion is a specific reaction mechanism.  I will need to confirm, but I believe that, for example, the reactions in the CNO cycles proceed mainly through radiative capture, which isn't fusion.  I can find comments in the introduction instructing me not to correct the """"general"""" statement about nucleosynthesis, but the point is that this is generalized so much that it is incorrect.  I can even find comments there saying not to link to the s-process, but the s-process does not involve fusion reactions as far as I know.  There are actually a rather limited number of stellar nucleosynthesis cases that actually proceed through the fusion mechanism, such as carbon burning and oxygen burning.  These are literally the only two examples I can think of off hand that I'm sure proceed via fusion.  All the rest I'm fairly dubious about at the moment, although some of the pp-chain reactions may also be fusion.

Thus, we in fact need likely a whole section explaining the nuclear physics of fusion and what it is and what it is not.

Finally, I noticed that the article suggested humans have never controlled fusion.  This is naff.  There are plenty of nuclear physics experiments which have not only controlled fusion, but made very careful measurements of the properties of the fusion mechanism at many energy scales.  Clearly, the writer wanted to imply that fusion as a source of stable source of energy has never been achieved by humans, so this was changed to reflect that point.

But given that I could find a serious physics error in every paragraph I read so far, clearly this article needs some serious attention Please do not revert my corrections without discussing the matter here or explicit citation indicating that I am incorrect.    """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Night: Here's your cite, which actually addresses several of your wishes: WP Biographies of Living Persons. You should look especially to: """"Using the subject as a self-published source"""" - it states that """"the article is not based primarily on such sources."""". Thirteen of your eighteen source references are to Pedro and Me, or Winick's personal sites (yes, IMDB counts). For example, you cite the book as the reason for keeping in the discussion of Rainey, while I repeat-it's an isolated, non-turning-point event in his life. It is appropriate for the Real World page, perhaps, but here it's a little off-topic. You might as well put in the name of a flavor of ice cream he doesn't like, or that someone was mean to him in middle school. It's just not important enough for what should be a short bio. And a link to Zamora's bio can cover his illness, a mention that he had HIV/AIDS and was ill covers him quite nicelythere's no need to go into it, except for the impact it had on Winick.

 Rayleigh scattering 

There is a """"citation needed"""" at the claim that Rayleigh scattering can be seen. I just did some research on Rayleigh scattering in air; I added some content to Rayleigh scattering. The bottom line is that at atmospheric pressure, Rayleigh scattering at 532 nm is about 10^-5 per meter. A 1 mW green laser has a luminous power of 0.6 lumen, and hence rayleigh scattering is 6e-6 lumen per meter over a 2 mm beam (a 0.002 m2 surface). The beam will hence appear roughly as if it were illuminated at 6e-6/0.002 = 3 millilux, which is comparable to a moonless clear night sky. (I should actually correct the number to deal with the angular distribution). A dark-adapted eye should be able to see this, especially when you look along the beam, which multiplies the apparent brightness by 1/sin(theta) where theta=0 deg means you look paralell to the beam.

Now I'm not sure how to turn this original research into verifiable encyclopedic content.  (t) """,0,0,0,0,0,0

First off, your baseless accusations. You accused me of bad faith. Precious. As recently as yesterday you refereed to the inclusion of Dado Prso's first name in the article (as is the case on hundreds of other sportspeople bios throughout Wiki), as a """"Serb nationalist talking point"""", a """"thinly veiled political advocacy"""", and an """"unverified Serbian name claim"""", also back in 2006 you were dismissive of the AFP source, at one point even calling for Prso's ID scan. When I brought this up, your response was calling it a figment of my imagination and making ridiculous accusations of bad faith!? You also accused me of proving a point, basing it on my mere presence here. The only reason I'm here posting on this page now is your removal of Prso's first name based on a claim that its inclusion is """" tendentious & unreferenced"""". Clearly there are and there have been references on this page all along. Frankly I found it extremely unlikely that someone as nit-picky and anal as you would fail to notice the references on the talk page when you removed the first name from the article, but I guess it's possible. Also, as per your """"I (Joy) didn't overlook anything - none of these links were referenced in the article or in the talk page"""" claim, it is not true. The first three links I presented to you just above have been on this talk page page for 8 years (and the AFP story from the FIFA official page is among them) and you clearly were aware of them back in 2006 as the ANON referenced them when addressing you directly and you even mention some explicitly yourself in your responses. So assuming in good faith that your failure to notice them now in 2014 was an honest oversight on your part I have to inform you once again that you DID overlook them because they've been here all this time. For the dissection of the Nezavisne ref, I'm not even sure what you're pushing and arguing for there. Nobody on this page, least of all me, has disputed that he goes by Dado (the article is called Dado Prso in case you failed to notice that too) so why you felt compelled to argue that is beyond me. From the best that I could gather, you don't want his first name Miladin in the intro, but you can live with it in the 'early career' section and you're basing all of this this on the fact that when you total them up most references are to Dado and Miladin, which is completely ridiculous, IF this is what you're arguing for (if not forget the previous sentence). Yes, of course they're to Dado, this is what he goes by, but that doesn't negate his first name.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

You can't just go out to your local gym, alert the media and complete the lift. It has to be judged by an existing set of regulations. What is a lift? Is there a pause on the chest? Can the athlete use legs to push? Can they be on drugs? Who tests? How often? Who weighs the official plates that were used? Does it have to be a standard bench? Are you allowed to put bungee cords under your lifting shirt? When is the lift complete? Lucky for us there is already an organization, recognized by the world, that takes care of all there rules and regulations. The argument is simple.

""""Picasso remained neutral during World War I, the Spanish Civil War, and World War II, refusing to fight for any side or country. As a Spanish citizen living in France, Picasso was under no compulsion to fight against the invading Germans in either World War. In the Spanish Civil War, service for Spaniards living abroad was optional and would have involved a voluntary return to the country to join either side. While Picasso expressed anger and condemnation of Francisco Franco and fascists through his art, he did not take up arms against them. He also remained aloof from the Catalan independence movement during his youth despite expressing general support and being friendly with activists within it.""""

This uncited paragraph has lingered here for some time, but its point is not clear. The fact that it's uncited warrants its removal. And there's a POV lurking here, but I can't seem to put my finger on it. If you have no objection, I'll remove it.

Deleting my page Ahontoay was not necessary. I read the reason for the page's deletion and the following may help you learn more information about this group of non treaty Montana Chippewa Indians. You claimed you searched for anything about Ahontoay on wikipedia. You can try searching by using the name Ahonteways but it won't work. Search by using the phrase User:Linniebc/SandBox. That will quickly lead you to the wikipedia page with A-Hon-Te-Ways. Though the phrase is a wikipedia's contributor's name, it is the only way you'll find it. That is the only wikipedia page with that name. The Ahontoay are a non federally recognized group of Chippewa's in Montana. The United States has no jurisdiction over them. 

The only way to find out about this group of non treaty Chippewa's, is by using google or another search engine. Google Ahontoay and you will find that the name is spelt as Ahontoay. The wikipedia page spells it as Ahonteways, which is not the correct way of spelling the chiefs name on the historical records i have found on the internet. Don't get the two names Ahontoay and Ahonteways, mixed up. They are not two different peoples but the same people. Chief Ahontoay did not take treaty. He never lived on a Reservation which proves he refused to cooperate with the United States. You will have to deal with the obvious difference in name spelling. It is not right to delete my page because it is not a hoax. It is based on real historical events. 

I will complain to your superior if you refuse to return my page. My page is not a hoax.

 The argument from majority 

Fine, this is Wikipedia and not primary literature, so the argument from majority is not automatically considered a logical fallacy. OK.

But how many people have rejected the DC hypothesis for reasons other than """"bah, yet another long-range proposal""""? (Again, the fact that the Proto-Caucasian and Proto-Sino-Tibetan reconstructions used are difficult to test is in the article – you're welcome to move it to a more prominent position.) Sure, Trask has, mainly because his reconstruction of Pre-Basque is different. (I will mention this more prominently in the article.) But besides?

Here is a post by Stefan Georg on when a hypothesis on language relationships should be considered accepted. For the record, Georg is currently most famous for fighting against the Altaic hypothesis (though he accepts a Tungusic-Korean-Japonic grouping as likely), rejects Nostratic, rejects DC, but accepts Seefloth's Uralo-Siberian because it's based on morphology. Here is a follow-up by Trask, here one by Vovin, and here another one by Georg.

To be an Indo-Europeanist, you have to know a lot about each of the branches of IE. How many people, other than the late Starostin, have anything near that kind of knowledge about East Caucasian and West Caucasian and Yeniseian and Sino-Tibetan and so on? Bengtson seems to be working on it, but he almost completely limits himself to Basque, the two Caucasians, and Burushaski (which he finds to be closely related), but he almost never mentions Sino-Tibetan or Na-Dené. That makes about one half of a person that is capable of judging the DC hypothesis (as a whole) beyond finding mistakes in the data from one of the supposed members. For that matter, Starostin himself largely ignored Na-Dené, Basque, and Burushaski.

Is there (already) a paper that takes the proposed evidence apart? If so, I'll be glad to cite it. (For the record, here is a discussion of a paper that shows, IMHO quite clearly, that what little evidence there was for including Omotic in Afro-Asiatic was wrong. A link to that paper is included.)

Here, incidentally, is an introduction to Burushaski – secondary literature – which makes favorable comparisons to Yeniseian and Sino-Tibetan.

In sum, I don't see anything wrong with presenting the hypothesis (in its latest incarnation) on Wikipedia. It is a controversial discussion subject, so (comparatively) many people will find it interesting.

In the meantime, I'll add some morphological evidence (suppletive pronoun paradigms, noun class prefixes) to the Macro-Caucasian section of the article, provided that Bengtson tells me that this paper is actually published. I'll also try to make more mention of the hypotheses that combine Sino-Tibetan with geographically adjacent families and thus contradict DC.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

There were far more massacres in this period than only Menemen, the article dis proportionally ignored the casualties of the Turkish civilians during this war. So I rightfully improved the article, it also is not forbidden to add info about more massacres, in fact it is encouraged. This has nothing to do with propaganda in my case. But you are trying to remove sourced content only because you WP:JDLI don't like it. This is trying to censor wikipedia and ignoreWP:NEUTRAL. On the other hand you are trying to do some kind of """"retaliation"""", adding massacres committed by Turks to Turkish cities, events, to the list. This is no problem if it is reliably sourced, but on the other hand you persistently try to prevent information about Greek massacres against Turks. So think about your actions.

 First project for Wikipedia 

As of April 2, 2008, edited this page as first project.  Any comments appreciated.  Did the following:
 From previous posts, learned that page direction was for terminology, not necessarily biology. But added more succinct genetic information citation to definition, making the body of the text heavier.  Added short biology section because of this.
 Found more usage of the term """"black sheep."""" Depending on the group culture using the phrase, it was either positive or negative, so further clarified usage by splitting the term into two groupings with citations and examples for each.  I know Baa Baa Black Sheep was removed once.  However, it is an example of the use of the term.  The other examples should be obvious.  If not how do I clarify.
 Did not find a standard template for citation on this page.  Would anyone let me know what the standard for this page is and how it was chosen, and I will go back and change.  Thanks.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Look:
I don't care where you took this chart from, remember well: Bulgarian has six vowels, SIX, SIX, SIX and NOT eight. There are four other allophones (two between a and @ and two between o and u), which appear in unstressed syllables depending on the position of the unstressed syllable to the stressed syllable within a certain word. If you are posting also allophones and not only phonemes (the reasonable question is why you are doing this but we'll deal with this some other time), then the vowel chart should include all ten of them and not only eight with information which is an allophone and which is a phoneme. But you don't know that, do you?

Then we get to another reasonable question: why do you think that you can erase the whole vowel section with the vowel descriptions? Ha? 

So: you post a chart which is WRONG and then you erase a section which is RIGHT. What the hell are you doing? I am getting tired of non-experts who read something somewhere and then come and try to wreak havoc on articles which they understand nothing about.

I don't have any research data exactly, but I am an American who was a US Navy dependent wife living in Athens when the Polytechnic uprising occurred. And since I was there, although not directly involved in the uprising (just got caught in some of the crossfire) my perspective is quite different from what has been presented on the pages.  I would like to share with you what my experience was, and perhaps it could lead to some further illumination of what really happened during that month or 2. (It wasn't all over in 2-3 days, as the story indicates) And there were many more killed than the numbers listed, although I have no evidence of this. I personally saw beatings and shooting by police and army at the Polytechnic when I took a friend to deliver food to her brother who was a participant in the uprising. Her name was Litha and his was Vagellis. I no longer recall last names, but could probably find out from some old friends. She came to New York to attend college in the mid to late 1970s.

The question that has always haunted me is why the US government totally ignored the entire situation in spite of the fact that the 6th fleet was anchored at Elyfsis and the AirForce base was fully manned and operational. The American press did not even report the uprising. As I was only 21 at the time, my parents watched carefully for some news of what I had written to them once mail service was restored, and only a short virtually nondescript article from UPS showed up buried in the back pages of the newspapers. It was never even mentioned on television here.

Yes, that's how I assumed it worked as well, but where's this """"somewhere else"""" that led to the creation of this article? I would assume hip hop culture, but the only place I find is hip hop music which also contains much more than a summary in its old school section. You're right that this article is meant to be an extension of another article, but it's currently only an extension of hip hop music and should therefore be called old school hip hop music.

It might be wise to let old school hip hop redirect to old school hip hop music for a while, however, as many other articles link here. When a section about old school hip hop appears in hip hop culture, we could redirect old school hip hop there instead, until that section grows big enough to justify its own article about general old school hip hop, like you said.

While at Harvard College 19-year-old Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg allegedly used login data from his social network to hack into fellow students email accounts; that evidence also included instant message transcripts where he calls facebook users """"dumb fucks"""". The alleged following exchange is between a 19-year-old Mark Zuckerberg and a friend shortly after Mark launched The Facebook in his dorm room:
 
Zuck: Yeah so if you ever need info about anyone at Harvard

Zuck: Just ask.

Zuck: I have over 4,000 emails, pictures, addresses, SNS

[Redacted Friend's Name]: What? How'd you manage that one?

Zuck: People just submitted it.

Zuck: I don't know why.

Zuck: They """"trust me""""

Zuck: Dumb fucks.

I am writing this message to you as a notice of my withdrawal from Wikipedia following the recent events/edits on the CNN and Susan Roesgen pages – events that you were involved in.  Never in all of my years in academia (the better part of a decade) have I been privy to such patently-insincere and downright academically-fraudulent work as that which I have encountered on Wikipedia.
While I was initially willing to set aside all of the negative things I had heard about Wikipedia in an effort to contribute to a seemingly beneficial project, the actions of editors and administrators on the  Susan Roesgen and CNN pages has made it eminently clear that “scholarship” and Wikipedia truly are mutually exclusive – propaganda has carried the day.
My failure to grace the project with some actual academically-sound work was not made in vain; with every neutral editor that you drive out of the project with your blatantly POV-pushing agenda, you further bolster your reputation as nothing but an unreliable propaganda board. Your reputation for unreliability was perhaps best captured in a recent statement made by my corporations professor: “I decided to make myself more ignorant on the topic by looking at the article (Dodge v. Ford Motor Company) on Wikipedia.”
I strongly encourage you to alter your course, set aside your agenda, and reverse your – and Wikipedia’s – reputation as a laughing stock. This will not only benefit the public in general, but will, I submit, actually make you feel better about yourself. Best, J.M.",0,0,0,0,0,0

More importantly, anyone with the first-hand expertise you have should easily be able to provide a specific excerpt for your claim.

The source should be cited clearly and precisely to enable readers to find the text that supports the article content in question....

""""conflict of interest edits are strongly discouraged.... Adding material that appears to promote the interests or visibility of an article's author, ... employer, associates, or his business or personal interests, places the author in a conflict of interest.... If other editors suggest that your editing violates Wikipedia's standards, take that advice seriously and consider stepping back, reassessing your edits, and discussing your intentions with the community. In particular, consider whether you are editing tendentiously.""""  WP:COI (emphasis added)

There is some interesting stuff about the comparison between doing this prize with a mouse and doing it with fruitflies (drosophila). A couple of the more interesting points are that in a lab you can cheaply maintain and process larger numbers of fruitflies than mice, and the fruitfly lifespan is much shorter than the mouse lifespan so you get quicker feedback.

But I also understand the publicity argument that people feel more kinship with mice. It's easier as a non-scientist to believe that results in mice are much more relevant to humans. Results in mice will more easily attract funding for subsequent work.

Does it make sense for researchers to work with fruitflies first, and then port their techniques to mice for later 
confirmation and to collect the prize? Hopefully that would take relatively little more time and expense than doing the whole thing with fruitflies. We'd eventually need to port these techniques from mice to humans anyway, so there is a presumption that porting across species is feasible.",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Remembrance Rock estimate 

The article has a 532,030 word count, referenced to the book's amazon.com page.  How, exactly, is this a reference to the word count?

In writing the RR page, I've been going over some original reviews.  One of the NYT reviews gave a word count of """"half a million and change"""".  Guess we'll not cite that.  The WP review, which I cite, gave a count of 650,000, which seems way too high.  So I made my own estimate, and came up with 543,000, see the footnote.

From: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An-Nisa,_34
In the Qur'an, verse 34 of Surah an-Nisa (abbreviated as 4:34) concerns the issue of marital relations in Islam. This verse is interpreted by some Muslims as giving women a degree of autonomy over their own income and property but obliging them to comply with the husband's wishes should they be congruent with Islamic principles and beneficial to the marriage. The verse is also interpreted to mean that men are also obliged to be responsible for maintenance of their female relatives.[1]

There are a number of translations of this verse from the Arabic original, and all vary to some extent. [2]Some Muslims, such as Islamic feminist groups, argue that Muslim men use the text as an excuse for domestic violence.[3] However, some have translated """"beat"""" as """"separate"""", as Arabic in its nature is a multi-meaning language, and as such no word has a fixed sole meaning.[4]

Ibn Abbas, a companion of Muhammad, wrote the earliest commentary on the Quran, and to this part he himself said this is only a light tap.[5] When asked about the light hitting, he said it refers to using a siwak (toothbrush). There are sources that say that Muhammad himself never hit a woman and forbade it.[6] Furthermore, Muhammad commented on this verse, where he said “a light tap that leaves no mark.”[7]

 bail out or bale out? 
For """"escape by parachute"""", my copy of Chambers Dictionary authorizes both spellings equally. I am British. I am more familiar with the spelling """"bale out"""". Perhaps this is yet another case where usual UK and USA spellings differ.  
First, """"bailing water"""" is never spelt baling water and I doubt you'd find that in Chambers.
For the parachute bailing, we use British English almost exclusively for the most part in Australia too, yet I've never once seen this use of bale (as in """"bale out of an aircraft"""") although it is evidently an alternate spelling of bail. But since """"bail out of an aircraft"""" is the way it's spelt at least 50% of the time in Britain and close to 100% of the time elsewhere (according to this WorldWideWords article), don't you think this information should go at the Bail disambig page on Wikipedia  and there is already a link to this from Bale.

I'm not proposing a total rewrite, just to condense the main points so you don't have to remove that one paragraph in its entirety. I'm proposing Ling.Nut-Lite. I just don't think removing that whole paragraph is the best solution. I want to condense it to just the main points, leaving certain details for further discussion in the body. Here's what I propose so far:

The Six Day War or June War..., also known as the 1967 Arab-Israeli war or the Third Arab-Israeli War, was fought between 5 June and 10 June, 1967 by Israel and the neighboring states of Egypt [then the United Arab Republic, UAR], Jordan, and Syria. At the war's end, Israel had seized the Gaza Strip and the Sinai Peninsula from Egypt, the West Bank and East Jerusalem from Jordan, and the Golan Heights from Syria.

After the 1956 Suez Crisis, Egypt agreed to the stationing of a United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF) in the Sinai to ensure compliance with the armistice agreement and prevent raids across the border . On 4 November 1966, Syria signed a mutual defense agreement with Egypt. Nine days later, Israel attacked the city of as-Samu in the Jordanian occupied West Bank in response to raids from the fedayeen group Fatah. King Hussein of Jordan criticized President Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt for failing to come to Jordan's aid and """"hiding behind UNEF skirts"""" [I checked Oren p. 135 and there's no mention of this on that page; please help double check source and find reference - possible later printing is different, I have 2003 first edition].

On 14 May 1967, Nasser began sending Egyptian forces into the Sinai Peninsula. Two days later he requested and obtained the withdrawal of UNEF from Egyptian territory. Israel rejected a proposal to restation UNEF on its side of the border. Egyptian forces replaced UNEF positions at Sharm el-Sheikh in the southern Sinai overlooking the Straits of Tiran. Between 18 and 20 May Israel reiterated declarations made in 1957 that any closure of the Straits would be considered as a cassus belli, or justification for war. Nasser declared the Straits closed to Israeli shipping on 22-23 May. On 1 June, Israel formed a National Unity Government by widening its cabinet, and on 4 June the decision was made to go to war. The next morning, Israel launched Operation Focus, a large-scale surprise air strike that was the opening of the Six Day War.

I think following this, since the lede really only mentions the war between Israel and Egypt, there should be a brief discussion of the Jordan and Syria fronts, as well. With this slimmer version, it should be possible to fit that in, at least briefly. Let me know what you think.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

First of all, congratulations on the Good Article status.  Nice work.

Since you don't object, I have added that section back to Little Boy.  That action should not affect its good article status.

Here is my reasoning.  That particular bomb design is uniquely associated with the Hiroshima bombing, which, in turn, was largely a public weapon effects demonstration.  Its purpose was to show that a single bomb could duplicate the effects of, say, the Tokyo firebombing which required 279 airplanes and 1,700 tons of bombs.

Hiroshima was spared any earlier bombing in order to serve as a pristine nuclear bomb target, a situation made possible by its lack of importance as a military target.  The two airplanes that accompanied Enola Gay were there to measure the weapon effects.  Nobody expected the loss of Hiroshima to tip the balance in favor of immediate surrender.  The """"shock and awe"""" was expected to come from observing that it was effect of a single bomb.

Most of what we know about nuclear weapon effects comes from an intensive study of Hiroshima.  It was flat urban terrain well protected by natural and artificial firebreaks, and it was enough larger than the total destruction area that the margins of the effects could be precisely measured.  Nothing new was learned from Nagasaki, and no other bombs were tested on live urban targets.  In the many test explosions that followed, large and small, the overpressure and thermal impulse contours were measured, and the Hiroshima effects were extrapolated to estimate the theoretical destruction area.

Granted, it was pure happenstance that Little Boy, and not Fat Man, was used at Hiroshima, but since it was this discussion of weapon effects seems appropriate here.

df0e68ecd04e1db4,"Jesse Ragan deletion nomination
Hi, I have received notice that the page I began about Jesse Ragan has been nominated for deletion based upon suspicion it is a vanity article. First, I am not the man (assuming Jesse ragan is male), nor have I met him/her. I began the article because as a professor of typography I felt Ragan's work significant, and that s/he had achieved work of lasting merit fairly early in life. S/he has been several time recognized by the American Institute of Graphic Arts (AIGA) (the national professional organization for graphic designers), Ragan's work has appeared in respected design periodicals, and has lectured on typography at several Association of Independent Colleges of Art and Design (AICAD) institutions. 

Several days ago I noticed removal of Ragan's name from credits for typefaces on the Tobias Frere-Jones article. My first thought was that some disagrement might have occured between Ragan and his former employers Hoefler & Frere-Jones, perhaps leading to a nomination for deletion. Mr. Hoefler wrote to me publicly on my talk page that Jesse Ragan was only one of many who worked on the project. That may be the case, but that would not discredit typefaces Ragan has produced entirely on his own, or the two mentions of his contributions to the Archer typeface on the AIGA web site. Clearly, at some point someone at Hoefler & Frere-Jones thought Ragan's contributions significant enough to provide his/her name (and not the rest of that team) to our national professional organization. The fact that Mr./Ms. Ragan is now independent and a competitor to other type foundries might be a part of this. But I have no knowledge of this. I know none of these people personally, and I respect the work of all of them as a review of my edit history will suggest. My primary reason for beginning the article was to increase the number of articles on typeface designers, and a secondary desire to increase the number of typography related articles in general. Jesse Ragan's work is very solid, even his/her own direct client list is impressive. In the world of typography, apprentices are historically given credit, witness Francesco Griffo who apprenticed to Aldus Manutius. It is my hope that Wikipedia will continue to make some room for subjects that though not block buster in scale are significant.",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Exactly why this article should be deleted 
Since some editors have deplorable difficulty understanding (as ITAQALLAH laments """"but on the talk page never explains in detail how the content is in accordance with policy, and ignores any policies that I may cite"""") why this article deserves to be deleted, I will once more explain now being very precise and exact so that you may be cleared of all doubts.

The article (in its post-censorsed state) is in violation of WP:BLP.
Let me quote from it: 

Editors must take particular care adding biographical material about a living person to any Wikipedia page. Such material requires a high degree of sensitivity, and must adhere strictly to all applicable laws in the United States and to all of our content policies, especially:

 Neutral point of view (NPOV)
 Verifiability
 No original research

This article violates requirement number One: Neutral point of view (NPOV)

Now for idiotic editors (like those who childishly colour their usernames) who will have difficulty comprehending how on earth this article violates NPOV (owing to their idiocy, which I hope Eugenics will fix one day) let me quote section 2.5 from the NPOV page:

Balance

When reputable sources contradict one another, the core of the NPOV policy is to let competing approaches exist on the same page: work for balance, that is: describe the opposing viewpoints according to reputability of the sources, and give precedence to those sources that have been the most successful in presenting facts in an equally balanced manner.

It says """"describe the opposing viewpoints"""". And where does this article do that ???
Rather than describe describe the opposing viewpoints, it suppresses opposing viewpoints.

This is why the article is biased, censorsed and therefore must be deleted.

I will be re-inserting the PROD tag in 24 hours if no one can come up with an argument that justifies having a biased viewpoint or can explain why and how the """"describe the opposing viewpoints"""" requirement is insignificant enough to be ignored. -   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

My apologies to those who feel that I have had a go at them in my haste to defend the LK posts. When I received the email (allegedly) from him, I genuinely thought it was him asking for support. I should have checked out the status before joining in, and it was only later that I realised that this wasn't the person that I actually know. It was clear after reading through the entire history that something was definitely not right. Geoff is quite rightly furious and is taking every step possible to find the protagonists. He has asked for his account to be suspended until further notice as he does not want this sort of thing to be repeated. I was very curious as he normally keeps his involvement in Templary quite private. There are however a few people out there who he has exposed for fraudulent activity and who will do nothing to get back at him. I am also very upset and can understand if editors do not want me to help out. Geoff's advice is to not get involved if these sort of problems can occur. But I am fairly good at reference checking, spelling and grammar if you require any help. I will also understand if you feel that my premature support without checking a real identity is disbarment to future assistance. Whichever way I wish you the best with the article on a subject that we are all like to study and promote. Geoff has emailed me to also pass on his wishes to all concerned and hopes you will understand his personal wish not to get involved.

Each barangay is headed by a barangay captain (punong barangay) i.e. the district mayor, who leads the barangay council (sangguniang barangay) composed of barangay councilors (kagawad). Every barangay also has a Youth Council (""""Sangguniang Kabataan"""" or """"SK"""") composed of the SK President or Chairman and SK Councilors, who direct the youth-oriented activities, such as basketball leagues and other youth oriented activities, in the barangay.

Historically, a barangay is a relatively small community of around 50 to 100 families. Most villages have only thirty to one hundred houses and the population varies from one hundred to five hundred persons. According to Legazpi, he found communities with twenty to thirty people only. Many coastal villages in the Visayan region consisted of no more than eight to ten houses. The word itself is derived from an ancient Malay boat called a balangay. This connection between community and boat supports certain theories on the history of the pre-colonial Philippines, specifically, that each original coastal “barangay” formed as a result of settlers arriving by boat from other places in Southeast Asia.

Assuming that J.C existed (before anyone picks my grammar apart!);
 There is no record in the new testament stating he was born in a stable, that's a misinterpretation, and as far as I know a fairly recent one, based on references to animals and mangers being inside a house.  
 The house in question is in Bethlehem according to two gospels and a prophecy.  
 Although the place of birth is disputed (and, I think, it is generally thought the original gospels had him being born in Nazareth) the passages about Mary and Joseph staying in a house/stable relate to a supposed trip to Bethlehem.  
 Bethlehem is a long way from Nazareth

Either the story should say Bethlehem, or the stone is some sort of crib from a house in Nazareth, or the myth itself is based on an alternative historical version (I was going to say inaccurate, but given we've already got two contradictory and both disputed accounts of possible event it's all a bit of a matter of opinion anyway!)",0,0,0,0,0,0

The most important illuminator of the 16th century, he was a 'Michelangelo of small works', according to Vasari. Many of his documented works are dispersed or untraced, and some attributions are controversial, but his secure oeuvre gives a clear idea of his stylistic influences and development. Although much of his inspiration came from Raphael and Michelangelo, he developed his own visual language, brilliantly translating their monumental forms for work on the smallest scale.

e130ab0ed26b5a34,"History > Recent Years > CWCC Paragraph 

This whole paragraph should be removed or at the very least reworked (and probably moved to Tourism) for several reasons:
 * The paragraph is proportionally way too long; this article is on Cambodia, not on an alleged scandal  of a local NGO
 * It only offers one side of the story
 * It uses few valid references (most of them being articles from the same source: stuff.co.nz)
 * Right now, it sounds like a friend of the NZ guy in this particular conflict between an alleged perpetrator and CWCC is taking a stand using Wikipedia, which would totally inappropriate

What, IMO, needs to be done to make it acceptable into this article:
 * Describe the other side of the story too: most of the time, sex offender will pay the girls family to push them to change their version of the story, sometimes accusing NGOs of forcing them into accusing the perpetrator.
 * Reduce the paragraph length, defocus on one incident and make it more general (if you can't, then that's a good hint this should never have been included) and move it to tourism section. Do not pollute the rest of the article
 * Include more reliable & diversified references (again if you can't, then that's another good hint of the inappropriateness of this paragraph)

Hi!  I noticed your activity as a Good Article reviewer, and wanted to let you know about the Wikipedia Ambassador Program, and specifically the role of Online Ambassador.  We're looking for friendly Wikipedians who are good at reviewing articles and giving feedback to serve as mentors for students who are assigned to write for Wikipedia in their classes.

If you're interested, I encourage you to take a look at the Online Ambassador guidelines; the """"mentorship process"""" describes roughly what will be expected of mentors in the coming term.  If that's something you want to do, please apply!

You can find instructions for applying at WP:ONLINE.  The main things we're looking for in Online Ambassadors are friendliness, regular activity (since mentorship is a commitment that spans several months), and the ability to give detailed, substantive feedback on articles (both short new articles, and longer, more mature ones).

I hope to hear from you soon.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Re, your message, Gogo is not responding because he isn't at his computer. He isn't a robot that's on 24/7/365. Your rudeness and impatience seems to know no bounds.

Are you going to give me an apology?  When you wrote that comment (January 3), you suggested that I was being 'impatient'.  But it's now 13 days LATER.  Dodo is being rather scarce, even today.   Your excuse, that Dodo didn't answer because he 'isn't at his computer' is wearing pretty thin, nearly two weeks later.  It looks to me that I was correct:  At the time, Dodo was not responding, but that was NOT because he 'isn't at his computer'.  Rather, he was not responding, because he had been caught doing 'drive-by edits'.   Dodo 'ran away', and he let his minions cover his ass while he ran.  At the time (January 3), you got away with claiming that I was being 'impatient', because it was at least plausible that Dodo wasn't at his computer.  But the validity of such an excuse hasn't stood the test of time.
It's really quite simple:  Wikipedia obviously attracts 'control freaks', 'info-Nazi's', etc.  Such people insinuate themselves into a position of control, as 'Administrators' if possible.  There, they abuse their positions.  Dodo needs to resign, and let some other person do that job.  And you need to stop defending him.",0,0,0,0,0,0

e2438cb0845d96c0,"Khalatnikov 

JETP isn't scanned yet, so Khalatnikov's contribution, which seem to be closer to Candlin than Salam and Matthews (Feynman also does something similar to Salam and Matthews in one of the electrodynamics papers, but without the Fermionic coherent states, and without the justification in terms of sum over intermediate states, which are both found in Candlin for the first time, I think.) This paper talks about the result: the integral over Fermionic fields is defined following Schwinger so that the action principle will work, and the result is that the determinant is in the numerator and not the denominator. This is most of Grassman integration, but without the formal anticommuting variables, which seem to have been introduced by Berezin and Candlin independently (at least according to this source). I did not read the original Berezin articles, only the 1965 textbook, so perhaps they are more complete than I originally thought. If anyone has read these, please include a summary of the contents. The real question, in my mind, is as follows:

 Feynman's propagator approach only requires that the statistics be correct when permuting the ends of the paths. The rest can be done by summing over particle paths, with appropriate projections to deal with Dirac eqn. So the early authors, between 1948-1954 are all dealing with formal anticommuting variables (no complete theory). This is true of the Schwinger action principle, and to a lesser extent, of Matthews and Salam.
 Matthews and Salam, like Feynman in his QEDIII paper, treat the sum over histories as green's function manipulations, without trying to formally define a calculus of anticommuting fields. They do define anticommuting sources, and anticommuting field Green's functions, but this is similar to Feynman and Schwinger. It does not have the crucial addition that the algebra of the fields in space-time makes sense, and the Fermi field integral is a sum over intermediate states.
 Khalatnikov seems to have understood the modern thing: that the Fermionic integral is a concept that is well defined. Unfortunately, I cannot access his paper. If anyone has access, please find out what is in there.
 Candlin defines the whole thing, in a very modern way. This paper is the best on the subject I have read, but it is similar to Berezin 1964.
 Berezin has some papers in the 1950s and 1960s, which seem to develop the whole thing indepedently, starting with Khalatnikov's observation. These papers are also crucial- who develops the Fermionic coherent states? And who shows that the Fermionic integral reproduces the sum over intermediate Fermionic states?

The whole thing is somewhat implicit in Matthews and Salam, but also in Schwinger and Feynman. The real important development is the identification of sum-over-intermediate states with grassmann integral. If someone can point out who did what, it would help a lot.",0,0,0,0,0,0

They'll continue to be content until their little world comes crashing down around them. Hopefully that'll help you understand why I didn't bother with them in the first place. I'll see you in awhile, my friend. Thank you for trying to help. afist '''''' """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 More on Gay Games VII 

Hi, Kile!  Forgive me for butting in, but I wanted to add an outside perspective...  You and Marc have been discussing some issues that are very tough to deal with in the context of an encyclopedia - and more so in the context of an open encyclopedia that anyone can edit.  You, as the director of the opening ceremonies (among other roles) are probably the best source there is for information on the subject.  But on the other hand, you're only one person, and you're not verifiable - by which I mean, that information is in your head and it isn't possible for anyone else to look it up and corroborate it.  Someone could ask you, but there again, you're only one person.  You can see the difficulties here )

There are a couple references I wanted to point you to that might help clarify the situation.  The first is Wikipedia's policy on Autobiographies - a similar area where the best source of information is the individual themselves.  And to point out how Wikipedia recognizes the issue at the topmost level, the second is the speech at Wikimania 2006 made by Jimmy Wales, the founder of the Wikimedia Foundation.

So those are my outsider's comments - I hope you continue to be a part of Wikipedia, and I hope you'll take a look at Wikisource - putting the speeches you mentioned on that site would be a great asset!

Wow, you're hopeless.  Lets start with the trifles; you spelled """"necessarily"""" wrong.  That doesn't give you much credibility.  The answer to your first question is no, whites from Liverpool speak Scouse, and they don't speak the same as whites from South London, of course, but I don't see what that has to do with White South African English.  However, the answer to your second question is mostly yes.  Most blacks from Boston do sound pretty much the same as blacks from New Orleans.  Most blacks from both areas speak what's called African American Vernacular English (of you're into political correctness, which you seem to be), which is an ethnolect and a sociolect that is becoming more and more different from the speech of whites in America.  I'm not exactly sure what you mean by """"Mother Tongue English speakers"""".  Do you mean L1 varieties?  
I don't think my final statement is a violation of WP:OWN because I never said I own this article, nor did I ever think that.  I simply temporarily """"took it over"""", if you will, to make it a better description of White South African English.  Those just happened to be the words I decided to use.  It says at the top of this article that the article was in need of attention by an expert on this subject, and while I am no expert, I certainly seem to be the closest thing to it that this article has ever seen (with the notable exception of JackLumber).  I think you knew what I meant by that expression, but it's certainly possible that you didn't.
Finally, I will respond to your earlier comment that """"White South African English"""" as a title for this article is """"simply racist"""".  You really haven't explained to me how that would be a racist title.  I'm going to assume that you meant either: 1.) That title would suggest that only whites in South Africa speak English and absolutely no one else does. 2.) That title would suggest that whites are the most important group in South Africa, they're are better than everyone else, and they are thus the only group in South Africa deserving an article on the type of English they speak.  Both of these choices seem rather absurd to me.  If you thought 1.), then I already proposed a solution for that.  We could give each Indian South African English, Black South African English, and White South African English its own article to show that there are indeed other dialects of English spoken in South Africa besides WSAfE.  If you thought 2.), then you are racist.  Let me explain.  For that title to be racist I would have to be white.  If I were a racist white person I would want that to be the title of the article to show that whites are better and that the way they speak is better.  Since we are both anonymous, however, there is no way you could possibly know my race.  You would have to rely on conjecture.  In this case, your guess was that I was white.  After all, if I were black and I proposed that, I would have to somehow be racist against myself.  What I don't understand for sure is why you assumed I was white.  That's quite a racist assumption.  Anyone in the world can edit Wikipedia; people from all races.  Yet you assumed I was white.  Unless you had statistics to back that assumption up, which you didn't, then that's """"simply racist"""".  Even if you did have statistics to back it up, it still could be racist.  To me, what you're saying is that only white people edit Wikipedia, and that people of other races aren't intelligent enough.  Of course, I don't for sure, but that's my conjecture.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Anyways, regarding about the 2000 New Flyer C40HF buses (5000-5222) they were at divisions 3, 5, 7 and 18. Although, a few of them were at SGV-3 division, when they were brand new and entering into service in the early 2000s, before being sent to divisions SB-5 and WSC-7. If you haven't noticed, a few of their cousins C40LF buses were at the same division they were, since one 5300 series bus was on line 180 in the early 2000s, when it was brand new. So, it wasn't the C40HFs that were at D3, their cousins were, too. 

Yeah, SB-5 division did have a few of the New Flyer D40LF buses (3000-3019) at one time, before they were sent to WSC-6 for almost their whole life, before 3 or 4 units were sent to Veolia Transportation (a bus contractor) in 2009 or 2010. I remembered riding one of those D40LF buses on line 115, when SB-5 used to operate that line, shared by SB-18,  which currently owns the line.

 a few suggestions on """"Measuring economic worth over time"""" 

I fully realize that this is a work in progress but thought a few suggestions could be useful. I'll post some specific ones on the talk page but more generally:

 Please don't take it the wrong way but I think quite often your writing style reflects academia too much - as if you were writing for an academic journal. However the intended target audience of the Wikipedia is different than that of a bunch of academics so care should be taken to avoid unnecessary nomenclature and jargon, as well as to avoid """"academic phrasing"""" in favor of simple formulations. More importantly I think one should be careful with introducing terms and concepts into the text that have not been defined previously and that a lay reader may be unfamiliar with, for example """"social cost"""" or """"social production"""".
 Speaking of """"social production"""" it'd be useful to standardize the terminology when it is being used. For example it seems like by """"proportions of social production"""" you refer to income shares of various classes (workers, capitalists, landlords etc) - if so, then that should be stated clearly, if not, the difference should be clarified. Likewise comparing the article title and the lead I think you're equivocating between """"economic worth"""" and """"social worth"""" which could be/are distinct concepts. Also because I'm probably coming at this from a different background I'm wondering what exactly is the relationship between """"social product"""" and more standard measures of production like GDP, income, etc.
 """"Both contemporary and historical wage price series are inherently controversial, as they speak to the standard of living of working class people."""" - I'm not sure if contemporary wage and price series are really """"inherently"""" controversial in the sense of being outright rejected by many researchers; at least that doesn't seem like the appropriate word here. Likewise, I don't think the reason why they are controversial/deemed important is because they concern """"working class people"""". They obviously concern all members of society whatever their class status. In a similar way the idea of """"economic worth"""" can refer to entities such as firms, charities, nations or even physical objects such as machinery and equipment.
 Proportion of gdp and the questions given as examples aren't really related. For example the question """"what was the opportunity cost of a £50,000 investment in 1840?"""" is not obviously or directly related to the question """"what was the social power of capital in 1840?"""".
 Some ideas for expansion: """"Theoretical problems"""" sections should link and perhaps briefly mention things like the LTV and marginalism, maybe something like the aggregation problem (though that article needs some serious work). """"Wage price series"""" can be expanded to include discussion of how these kind of data are generally collected (btw, I'm not sure what a """"real price"""" is here. An individual good price divided by a price index?). For historical wage price series there's also a good bit of data available for the Netherlands and to a lesser extent France and Germany. There's also sporadic data for a wide number of different societies which don't really constitute a series but do provide """"snapshot"""" views of the economy/society in time (all the way back to ancient Sumer). The main difficulty of comparing aggregates across time is the changing nature of a consumption basket and time usage, in particular introduction of new goods and disappearance of old ones (like Malleus alludes to above) - this should also be elaborated upon and made more explicit.

I'd really hate to barge in and edit a new article while it is still being written so I thought bringing up some suggestions here would be better. Thanks.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Review comments 

I took a brief look at the article after the recent peer review was closed. Here are a few comments for improvement - these are things that woulkd be a problem if this were up for WP:FAC or even WP:GAN.
The lead is five paragraphs but WP:LEAD says the limit is four paragraphs.
The lead does not summarize the article well - my rule of thumb is to include every section in the lead somehow, but the Munic Crisis, his marriage and children, his children with other women, and his death are not in the lead
WP:MOSQUOTE says that all direct quotations need to have a reference (even if they are in the lead)
To be free, most historic images need to have been published before 1923 or their source must be given so clearly that it can be determined that the image was published without a copyright notice or its copyright has expired. Images like File:CAL CAM2 DH4 Nov 4 1926.jpg were clearly taken after 1923, and lack the information as to sources that allow any sort of determination of copyright status.
Or how is this image not still under copyright - published in 1927 at the earliest File:CharlesLindbergh-RaymondOrteig.jpg?
The relevant policy for WP:FAIRUSE images is WP:NFCC, every point of which has to be met for an image to be used under fair use guidelines. I often ask myself three questions about fair use images: 1) Does the image increase the reader's understanding of the article's subject? 2) Is the image discussed in the article itself? 3) Is the image used merely for decorative purposes? NFCC requires minimal use - all of which leads to me to ask: How do two separate Fair Use covers of """"WE"""" increase the reader's understanding / meet minimal use?
MOS says not to sandwich text between images - this does so in several places.
I read Mosely's biography of Lindbergh years ago (it is cited here) and read WE as a kid. This seems to me to under play Lindbergh's isolationism and at least the perception of him as an appeaser / possible Nazi sympathizer. 
The language in the lead at least seems needlessly convoluted - look at what the page Lindbergh says """"Charles Lindbergh (1902–1974), first pilot to fly solo non-stop across the Atlantic"""" then look at how it described here """"As a 25-year-old U.S. Air Mail pilot Lindbergh emerged suddenly from virtual obscurity to instantaneous world fame as the result of his Orteig Prize-winning solo non-stop flight on May 20–21, 1927, made from Roosevelt Field[N 1] located in Garden City on New York's Long Island to Le Bourget Field in Paris, France, a distance of nearly 3,600 statute miles (5,800 km), in the single-seat, single-engine purpose built Ryan monoplane Spirit of St. Louis."""" The facts are all there, but it is so comvoluted that if you don't already know what Lindy did, you might miss it.
What makes """"Charleslindberg.com a reliable source? See WP:RS
In short, before you worry too much about the language, there is a lot of other stuff to fix here.

 Fullmetal Particle Man 

Another Youtube video (located here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahNYobJ_gjQ ) that I noticed that ALSO happens to fit extremely well features Fullmetal Alchemist characters in the positions of the four men;

Edward Elric (aka Ed, aka the Fullmetal Alchemist) is cast as Particle Man, this being the most obvious joke/reference; he's extremely touchy about his height, him being almost/most likely the shortest man in the military and NEARLY the shortest main character  I think that his brother Alphonse's real body takes that distinguishment away, however). In his sequence of the Youtube video, the lines are accompanied by rather apt sequences from the anime (among them, the line """"When he's underwater does he get wet, | Or does the water get him instead?"""" is accompanied by a clip of Ed sinking to the bottom of a body of water because of his prosthetic limbs  which happen to be made entirely of metal, hence his title the 'Fullmetal' Alchemist).

Colonel Roy Mustang (aka the Flame Alchemist) is cast as Triangle Man. Promoted at one point to Brigadier General and later became Fuhrer (sp?), he is constantly taking jabs at Edward (for a rather popular example, he more than occasionally jokes about Ed's height), though in one episode in the anime and a sidestory in the manga the two actually hold a battle on the parade grounds (with the Fuhrer's permission)  Mustang wins by a comeback landslide in the manga, but in the anime the then-Colonel hesitates (possibly due to post-traumatic stress disorder, as surmised due to a flashback being shown at that moment in the anime of a young man he had to kill in the Ishbal War) and thus loses to Ed; it is from the anime episode that the video actually gets the majority of its Particle Man VS Triangle Man footage.

Major Alex Louis Armstrong () is cast as Universe Man; all State Alchemists (such as, as noted before, Armstrong and Edward) carry watches, and in both manga and anime the man proudly brandishes his watch (supplying one shot used in the video if I recall), plus he is, despite his sheer size (he is easily tied with the husband of Izumi Curtis (sp?) as the tallest supporting character in the series) and power (he performs his particular brand of alchemy through the use of powerful punches  one scene in the anime has him pick up a slab of concrete with one hand, toss it in the air, and punch it, thus turning it into a massive bullet propelled at high speed via the punch's force). In the video, his power and compassion are both seen . . . along with his penchant for posing (most likely a trait passed down the Armstrong family line for generations  a lot of his many talents, from his alchemy to his skill at portraiture, seem to be this way).

Second Lieutenant Jean Havoc is cast as Person Man, and aptly so; out of all his co-workers, he seems to suffer the most problems, particularly in his love life  Mustang has effectively stolen every single girl he's dated in either series, anime or manga, with one exception (manga-only) being the homunculus Lust (going under the alias Solaris; admittedly, it was a poor choice, as she later was proved to have been using him and ended up wounding him in his leg to the point that he could not be of any use in the military, hence his subsequent resignation, plus the Flame Alchemist did in fact kill Lust during the same incident where she crippled Havoc). Hence, the line """"Triangle Man hates Person Man"""" is given even more meaning with this Youtube video. (Ironically, when the line """"Lives his life in a garbage can"""" comes up, it shows Roy Mustang's old residence back when he was obsessed with, if I remember correctly, human transmutation.)

He was not Taik, the ghorids themselves were believed to be Pashtuns and they were NOT native speakers of the Persian language rather patronizers of the culture. There seems to be a lot of vandalism and propaganda being posted by Tajiks here themselves, with no evidence being provided.

If [WP:VER] is intended to be weaponized then a bot could be made that deletes pages and sections based on whether the section contains an insufficiently prestigious reference.  Treating WP:VER as an intentional algorithm would allow an attacker to delete perhaps as high as 90% of wikipedia without even needing to look at the content.  No one could invoke any objection to the mass deletion if the literal interpretation of WP:VER is the most important rule on wikipedia.  Vandalism becomes impossible if criteria for removal applied to a science page can be robotically applied to a philosophy page.
 The above attack would meet a common sense interpretation of vandalism.  The only possible protection from the mass deletion attack is if [WP:VAN] is considered to have higher priority for literal interpretation than WP:VER.  There should already be a common sense acceptance that Vandalism is more dangerous and objectively assessed than the quality of referenced material, and as shown above, rejecting the statement binds wikipedia to a suicide pact.  Its my view that the recent deletions are indistinguishable from robotic vandalism and they deleted high quality and verifiable references based only on the content hosting platform.
 If Vandalism and Verifiability are to be equally considered in actions, then restoring the content and tagging it as needing better sources should be done.  Also if there is to be a defense from robotic deletion of the majority of wikipedia, then """"deletors"""" that have shown no previous contribution to the page should be treated more suspiciously than those who have helped build it.

This is childlish:

First of all, I am tired of people who show up to a page and think they have the right to add any modifications they feel like. Next time, before you have the intentions of modifying the alticle considerably (or the contents in this case) it would be wise to write down something in the discussion page, otheriwse you work might end up being in vane.
Secondly, the tempalte for the content is BY FAR THE UGLIEST I have ever seen. It quite hard for a newcomer to realize he has got to look through the text. The old content probably wasn't the best possible, but was significantly better. Also, the old content is not occupied by history in more than 50%. 
I understand Romania has a rich history, but the notion of independence was not a huge idea before 1800s. India has existed as a 'culture' long before the Roman Empire, therefore there is no point in comapring the importance of the history section of the two countries. Check the Germany article to see the model I have edited the format of the history section. You are welcome to edit the history section, but do not add 20 entries about history in the contents section (i.e.: that is why national awakening, independence and union are in the same section; feel free to modify the name, but do not further split it). Also, for similar reasons, there is little point in expanding the section about Dacia.
I might be worong, but you seem to play around a lot with the position of the images. Please do not. Right now they are placed where they are because of some specific reasons.
I will add more comment later 

Now the answers:
 You are welcome. Next time you add about 30k+ of information to an article and somebody comes and starts freaking with the article, you will be really happy.
 Appearance and professional looking? Is that what you are calling the template for the contents section? Come on, try to be objective and agrre that even the contents section on the present page is really ugly.
 I have allready replied to this and I do not feel the need to throw away some of my time to add more reasoning to this rather retarded dispute. Note: The big size also has a real outcome, and that is the article is really annoying to edit because it takes almost 10secs between the press of the save button and the reloading of the page (and it is not my connection)
 Again I allready explained this. The issue was not the byte count but the length of the contents section that took several pages to scroll down (and I think more than hald of the contents were SMALL entries into the history section).
 The article is about Romania, not about the History of Romania. Again feel free to click this link and edit. The history is there, it happened, and therefore the history ARTICLE should be expanded. """"(some of us hate to change pages!)"""" Some other readers hate to search stuff about Romania and have to scroll down through pages of history to get to some more present facts."""" Putting links is not equivilent to giving a reader a recap of the era—in particular, I find the way you did it in that page to be poorly prioritized."""" This is your opinion. The page has beeen previously reviewed by other users (check the article milistone) and they found it actually really aggreable and felt the need to specify the usefulness of the way it was 'prioritizied'.
 For exampel in Europa Yearbook (a kind of printed version of CIA Factbook that is printed yearly). Also, your example with journals is at least annoying. Journals are actually reviewed by professionals, which means that people who nt what is happening agree on those formalities. This is not Libertatea where you need to put catchy titles to make people buy your crap. This is an encyclopaedia and should have some professionalism in the way titles are given.
 I checked and decided the contents section is REAAAAALLY """"off-putting"""". It is unfortunate, but I find it fair to undo edits from people who do not ask first, than to reedit their edits.
 IT IS UGLY!!!!!! Also, what browsers? Anything that is not Firefox or IE has no weight. (i.e. even Opera is a niche browser)

Also, I did not get the joke about first of July. If you were refering to the date I have created this account, then... you are at least superficial to base your opinions on that. There are al least two possibilities that you cannot prove with this kind of research: 1) that I did not have another account before then. 2) that I did not do real publishing in real life (i.e. in real Journals, were people review your stuff before publishing)

1820 Map vs Globe
The image in the infobox should be a geographic locator as well, showing where the state is within a larger context of the world.
It doesn't seem consistent with map of other Chinese dynasty articles (e.g. Ming, Tang, etc). Geographic locator map is mainly used for current country map (not historical map), e.g. People's Republic of China, United States, etc   
The Qing Dynasty, although is a dynasty of the past, is also largely a modern political entity, and its history is intertwined with modern world history.  That's why I think a geographic locator is better suited, as it also mirrors the Republic of China (1912-1949) article.  Another thing to consider is that because there are so many contemporaneous maps of the Qing that's available (where as such maps are rare for prior historic dynasties, such as Ming and Tang), it is difficult to choose one that truly represent the whole article in the infobox.  

I agree that showing all the different maps of the Qing Dynasty at its various extent and time periods is informative to readers, but they don't have to be in the infobox; a general geographic locator is a good fit there.  Plus, the maps of the Qing Dynasty at 1820 and 1833 are already in the article.

 Equal Standards 
TheLeopard, I thank your for your unending quest for the truth, and your campaigning for the integrity of Wikipedia. However, there are other areas of Wikipedia that would greatly profit from similar vigor. Take for instance the previously widely unknown National Capital Region (China). You rescued it from obscurity caused by a redirect. However, it must have escaped you that this article does not contain a single reference, and that there are several claims and outright speculations that deserve at least a dubious tag. A National Capital Region (China) is worthy of the same attention to detail as China’s capital, or other cities such as Shanghai. While it is the job of the author to provide these references (lest the author would risk a deletion), the lack of verifiable sources should at least have been pointed out. I have done so in the meantime. Thank you   
The only reason I rescued that article was because it was redirected to Bohai Economic Rim, which clearly is not the same thing as National Capital Region.  The article needs to be tagged with """"unreferenced"""" and a bunch of other tags.

 Made in the USA? http://rexcurry.net/wikipedialies.html 

There are some regular writers on Wikipedia who knowingly engage in personal attacks and deletions (even of links) of anyone who explains the connection between Edward Bellamy and his cousin Francis Bellamy (author of the pledge of allegiance) and National Socialism. It is behavior that breaks Wikipedia's rules. What kind of people cover-up for Nazis and that horrid ideology?

Many regular writers on Wikipedia are lying liars and the lies they tell include the top media cover-ups. They cover up many historic photos of the Pledge of Allegiance http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html that reveal its original straight-arm salute.  They cover up the fact that the author of the Pledge of Allegiance (Francis Bellamy), and his cousin and cohort (Edward Bellamy), were National Socialists and supported the """"Nationalism"""" movement, the """"Nationalist"""" magazine, the """"Nationalist Educational Association,"""" their dogma of """"military socialism,"""" and Edward inspired the """"Nationalist Party.""""  They cover up the Pledge's straight-arm salute as the origin http://rexcurry.net/pledge1.html of the salute of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazis). As part of the cover up, they perpetuate the myth http://rexcurry.net/pledgesalute.html that the straight-arm salute was from ancient Rome.  They cover up discoveries by the historian Rex Curry.  The Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched outward toward the flag. Historic photographs are at http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html and at http://rexcurry.net/pledge_military.html showing the evolution of the gesture. Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-pledge.html is an extended military salute. A mnemonic device is the swastika (""""Hakenkreuz"""" in German).   Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent """"S"""" letters for their """"socialism.""""  Hitler altered his own signature http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html to use the same stylized """"S"""" letter for """"socialist."""" Wikipedia's liars cover up for the swastika http://rexcurry.net/swastikanews.html and its use as a sick socialist symbol. Wikipedia's liars cover up for the National Socialist German Worker's Party http://rexcurry.net/swastikamedia.html by overuse of the hackneyed shorthand """"Nazi.""""  Many Wikipedia posters are liars in that there was no """"Nazi Party"""" because it was actually the """"National Socialist German Workers' Party"""" and the party members did not call themselves """"Nazis"""" nor the """"Nazi Party.""""    The term """"Nazi"""" developed from slang using the first syllable in the German pronunciation of the """"National Socialist German Workers' Party.""""  In that sense, the author of the Pledge of Allegiance was a """"Nazi"""" too, in that the term means """"National Socialist.""""  The term """"Nazi"""" is also used to hide the National Socialist dogma behind the Pledge of Allegiance, its original gesture, and the National Socialist German Workers' Party.   

Wikipedia's liars use the term """"Nazi"""" and the misnomer """"Nazi Party"""" to cover-up the horrors of socialism. Wikipedia's liars cover up the the socialist trio of atrocities and and their socialist Wholecaust (of which the Holocaust was a part): 62 million people were slaughtered under the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics; 35 million were slaughtered under the Peoples' Republic of China; 21 million were slaughtered under the National Socialist German Workers' Party. They cover up the fact that socialists helped start WWII with the National Socialist German Workers' Party and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics together  http://rexcurry.net/socialistwar.html as allies in 1939. They cover up for and are deniers of the socialist Wholecaust, http://rexcurry.net/mediacoverup.html of which the monstrous Holocaust was a part.

Liars on Wikipedia repeat common lies http://rexcurry.net/mediapledge.html of the media. http://rexcurry.net/socialistmedia.html

Wikipedia should not be cited for support because it is no different than quoting various anonymous sources who have no knowledge of the topic http://rexcurry.net/wikipedialies.html or who have lies to spread about the topic.

The Wikipedia article for the """"Roman salute"""" used to be complete disinformation, deliberately maintained by liars who tried to perpetuate myths.  Here is an excerpt of what Wikipedia used to carry: """"The Roman salute is a closed finger, flat-palm-down hand raised at an angle (usually 45 degrees) and was used by the Roman Republic. It was also the historical civilian salute of the United States, from 1787?-1934?, known since 1892 as the Bellamy salute.

Thanks Random. I agree that that is a better approach, because it lets us de-couple the link text from the link. But in this case I think the redirects are legitimate, and it is good to point into the list via them as they insulate the template against any change in target. i.e. if someone creates an article on an R-phrase, the redirect can be re-targetted.

Alright, I am willing to concede that the CIA allegations are flimsy at best, therefore, I will stop the edit warring.  While you may not consider it too important, I think the issue of Assange as the founder to be another example of lazy journalism.  Your source for Assange as founder of Wikleaks was MSNBC.com.  I don't necessarily consider MSNBC to be a reliable source most of the time.  Corporate news does not do """"real"""" journalism.  They copy news from one source or they make stories up.  It seems to me that the idea of Assange as founder is a meme.  I have never read a quote from Assange whereby he states that he founded Wikileaks.  This idea seems to be mostly promulgated by the U.S. corporate media.  Perhaps to vilify him in the minds of Americans, so that later he can be lynched.  This seems like Propaganda 101 to me.

You've have been peddling this name about on different sites in Wikipedia and I've left it for proud Pakhtuns and others to challenge you. Get it into your ignorant head that Tanolis are Pakhtuns and Janjuas are kasbis (I know at least 3 families of Janjua origin who do not claim to rajputs but say they are of Maliyar caste. None of the historical sources link them with rajputs. Ghakhars use the title raja but are not rajputs as do the Turks of Hazara, in Manakrai,and they are not rajputs either - read about Raja of Mahmoodabad. Moreover, the real Rajputs of Rajputana use the universal title of Singh to denote their proud identity (the term raja is reserved for the rulers). As for the Gujjar issue it is well documented that Jat, Gujjar and the so-called rajputs of northern Punjab are the same people. This leads to the conclusion that maybe the Janjua claim to be rajput is suspect as I have said all along. Darbar-e-Akbari, Tuzuk-e-Jahangiri and other historical works do not mention Janjuas and Rajputs together and locate the former in Bhir far away from Hazara, and more importantly, from real Rajputs as well. 

I accept there are people who live in Tanawal and use Tanoli as their geographical origin but they do not fit into the clan system of the original Tanawalis. We know who the gujjar families are in Tanawal and they do not use Tanoli for themselves though they do say they reside in Tnawal. Other Gujjars in Hazara are either settled or are move about between Swat, Upper hazara and Azad Kashmir.

Additionally, you seem to be on a mission to prove something that is not proveable. I know you are in the UK and I can meet you face to face to discuss this if you prefer. We can sort a number of things relevant to this debate as well as you can know who I really am.

e67cb720b4ccd9b9,"Nature of the holdings in Mimms and Miller/“Police” vs. “peace officer” 

In carefully reviewing these cases, I cannot find support for the language I used several years ago, so I’ve revised it to strictly reflect what the Court actually said. Although the Court did not expressly require that a peace officer cite particularized concern for his safety, they did not expressly say that it was unnecessary, either.

The clarification of “federal law” is also important, because the Supreme Court, empowered under Article III of the US Constitution, cannot really grant “authority” to a peace officer; rather, they are limited to interpretation of laws and review for conformance with the Constitution, as they make quite clear in the citation from Mimms.

I’ve added a tag to the assertion that state law may not allow drivers or passengers to be ordered to exit the vehicle; though this assertion may be correct, it’s pretty sweeping, and needs support. It may be particularly significant in light of the Death of Sandra Bland. Many pundits have insisted that Ms. Bland’s failure to exit her car when so ordered provided cause for arrest, usually citing Mimms and Miller, and perhaps Texas Transportation Code §542.501. The Supreme Court holdings were of course limited to the Fourth Amendment, and did not (and could not) consider whether refusal to exit a vehicle after being so ordered violated state law; unless the Commerce Clause of Article I is somehow involved (and this seems unlikely), that would be a matter for state legislators to regulate, and state courts to interpret. Some states well may have done so; however, I have been unable to find anything close to dispositive, and have not seen anyone else do so. I am not going to make a project of running this down, but if someone else can provide this information, it would seem a great addition. Hopefully, any such reference would cite real decisional law that is unambiguous to the average reader, rather than a mere assertion by a third party (if the third party cannot cite authority, that party’s assertion is suspect).   

 “Police” vs. “peace officer” 
I do not understand the suggestion that “peace officer” or “law enforcement officer” is strictly the proper term needs support; I think the linked WP article makes it quite clear that either of these terms—which refer to a superset of “police officer”—are the strictly correct usage. I used “police” simply because in some other articles, other editors—usually IP—kept changing it to “police officer,” and the bickering seemed a poor use of time. And I reasoned that if the Supreme Court can use “police”—correctly or otherwise—we cannot be faulted for doing so here. Whoever added that tag did not give a reason; absent some good reason to keep it (or perhaps a suggested rewording of the note), I’m inclined to remove the tag.",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Nicosia and discrimination against Greek contributors and the Greek character of the city 

Dear Salvio,

You have accused me of abusive behaviour against other users and consequently blocked me from editing the article on Nicosia for a 24 hour period.

May I draw to your attention that it is fairly obvious that those three users namely Seb az86556 , Seric2  and Chesdovi) are clearly constantly creating a picture of Nicosia as a decadent muslim city that serves their religious beliefs and are all clearly hailing form Turkish backgrounds.

There is a constant undermining of the city´s Greek identity i.e. whenever a Greek flag, that is OMNIPRESENT in the Republic of Cyprus whether some people like it or detest it but this is the reality and an Encyclopedia that wishes to be UNBIASED should depict the REALITY and not the subjective views of a minority of readers that are furthermore based on extremist religious and nationalistic views. On the other hand, such users do find it appropriate to throw in pictures using the Turkish and the ILLEGAL, yes illegal according to United Nation referendums flat of the non-recognised internationally illegal self-proclaimed state of the so-called TRNC.

It is totally UNACCEPTABLE to have extremist nationalistic individuals, that strategically reached the level of administrators, deteriorating all the time the article on the city of Nicosia, promoting an unrealistic Turkish character and undermining the Greek character of the city AND  at the same time having an ADDITIONAL article on """"North Nicosia"""" that is depicting a totally FALSE picture w.r.t the city. The TRNC is illegal, not recognised by any state other than Turkey and some terrorist states that are non-democratic and yet Wikipedia has a page on Northern Nicosia by supposedly administrators that support the unification of Cyprus. This is clearly a major distortion of their intentions and a huge lie in that an individual that pretends to be a neutral aribtrator and a supoporter of reunification cannot have a separate page on Northern Nicosia stressing how Turkish it is and then go and literally destroy everything in the proper page for Nicosia and emphasize the Turkish character of the city, talk about the tension and the division of the city all the time and undermine the Greek character.

This is clear nationalistic and racial discrimination against the indisputable Greek character of the area controlled by the   Republic of Cyprus and furthermore it is downgrading for the Republic of Cyprus the mere fact that Wikipedia has a site that is CONSTANTLY vandalised by several ethnic Turkish extremists and Wikipedia users support such discriminatory behaviour.

In the light of all of this, I shall stop contributing to Wikipedia as I consider it downgrading for my own self. Furthermore, I do not wish to participate in an """"encyclopedic"""" project that is totally biased and discriminatory.

Vascular parkinsonism is produced by one or more small strokes that affect the basal ganglia. A stroke is the loss of activity of a discreet brain area (lesion) because of blockage of the blood supply to that brain region. Vascular diseases are associated with a higher prevalence of Parkinson's Disease [1]. There are three different pathologic states that produce Vascular Parkinsonism (VP), including multiple lacunar infarctions in the basal ganglia area [2,3], subcortical arteriosclerotic changes (Binswanger's disease) [2,3] and a single vascular lesion that present a clinical picture indistinguishable from Parkinson's disease [2,3,4]. Parkinson's Disease symptoms occur in Vascular Parkinsonism [5-12]. However, resting tremor is either reduced [5,6], or absent [7,8]. Only a minority, but a large minority, of people with Vascular Parkinsonism respond to L-dopa [9,10].

Ok I'm going to reproduce part of my page here again to close this matter. Censoring images in any way is against Wikipedia policies. Any questions? Compromises on Wikipedia policies is not allowed, needless to say. Please stay firm with people who attempt to violate Wikipedia policies.  (talk•contribs) 

How Wikipedia policies/guidelines may apply to issue of Muhammad's pictures

Wikipedia:Profanity
Words and images that would be considered offensive, profane, or obscene by typical Wikipedia readers should be used if and only if their omission would cause the article to be less informative, relevant, or accurate, and no equally suitable alternatives are available. Including information about offensive material is part of Wikipedia's encyclopedic mission; being offensive is not.

Some editors argue that in the light of this guideline:
 Typical Wikipedia readers do not find pictures of Muhammad offensive
 Exclusion of such pictures would result in the article being less informative, relevant and accurate.
 No suitable alternatives are available, as these pictures are historic
 As the policy states, """"Including information about offensive material is part of Wikipedia's encyclopedic mission; being offensive is not."""". Therefore, the primary mission of Wikipedia and its editors is to improve articles so they are more informative. Being offensive is not Wikipedia's mission.
 In addition, there are no issues of copyrights as the copyrights for all these pictures have expired so the images can be used freely where relevant.

WP:NOT#CENSORED
This policy states:
 Wikipedia may contain content that some readers consider objectionable or offensive.
 Wikipedia cannot guarantee that articles or images are tasteful to all users or adhere to specific social or religious norms or requirements.

Printing Images of Muhammad: A minority tradition?
Some users (Itaqallah and ALM) have suggested that since printing of Muhammad's images has , therefore Wikipedia too should not print the images otherwise it will be a violation of WP:UNDUE. Cartoon images of Muhammad have been printed all over the World and this is not likely to change now:

 List of newspapers that reprinted Jyllands-Posten's Muhammad cartoons

Printing of images is no longer a minority tradition and so UNDUE does not apply.  (talk•contribs) """,0,0,0,0,0,0

e772999b3d3a346b,"""==Celtic Language?==

It says in the article that after St. Patrick was captured he began to learn """"the Celtic language.""""  It is commonly agreed among Irish historians that the Irish are not actually Celtic (e.g. the Irish learned the Celtic style of art from communication with the European mainland, etc.).  So did they speak the Celt language? I defer to an expert on this one. 

To be more precise, what the article means is that he learned """"a Goidelic language"""" or """"the Old Irish language"""". Patrick would have already spoken a Brythonic language and some Latin. Depending on exactly where he came from in Britain, he might have known a Goidelic language as well. Celtic languages and Insular Celtic languages explain how Goidelic and Brythonic may have been related to each other and to other Celtic languages.   (Talk) 

Are you kidding?  Please identify your source in claiming that """"is commonly agreed among Irish historians that the Irish are not actually Celtic.""""  Recent research has revealed that the Celts did not displace pre-celtic peoples but Celts did come to Ireland and the predominant culture remained celtic until English colonization.  Second, Gaeilge is a celtic language of the Q-celtic branch of the Celtic language family, thus the Irish of Patrick's day spoke a celtic language and it is assumed that Patrick learned said language.  Ergo, he learned a celtic language (though, as noted above, he probably already spoke a P-celtic brythonic language prior to his enslavement.

I have seen broken dates for specific invasions of the British Isles from mainland europe during the collapse of the Roman empire, these not only include Picts, Scots, Irish, Angles and Saxons and more bizzarely English! I will have to dig the book out with dates.  

St. Patrick: Fact and Fiction

I have removed 'was captured by Niall Noigiallach' as it is an obvious error. I will try to come back some time in the future and help with citation and new material.

What are the sources for the following statments?

1 - """"born Patricius Magonus Sucatus""""
2 - """" seems to have studied at the monastery of Lérins on the Côte d'Azur from 412 to 415 ...He spent the next 15 years at Auxerre were he became a disciple of Saint Germanus of Auxerre and was ordained possibly about 417.""""
3 - """"Saint Germanus consecrated Patrick bishop about 431, and sent him to Ireland to succeed Saint Palladius, the first bishop, who had died earlier that year. """"
4 - """"There was some contact with the pope. Patrick visited Rome in 442 and 444. """"
5 - """"Popular devotion to Patrick began in France, long before Sucat received the noble title of Patricius""""

These and other statments seriously mar what is otherwise a fairly good and reasonably well written article. Also the chronology implicit in them is all over the place. The fact of the matter is that no one know for sure what the dates of Patrick's life are; those of 461 (arriving in Ireland) and 491 (death) are estimates arrived at only after decades of discussion. Will whoever rewrote this article please show the basis for including these statments. Thank you. 

I've re-revised the article again in line with what I wrote above, for the simple reason that Pcassidy reverted back to his version again without citing sources for statments I take issue with. I dislike doing this unilaterally because it is against the spirit of wikipedia, but it seems I have to draw attention to this in some manner other than being polite. , 18:52 pm, 18th April 2005.

 Proposed Intervening Section on """"Controversial New York Times Story"""" 

Rather than argue over the title or contents of the disputed second section regarding the pertinence of the controversial petition itself, I propose to insert an intervening section about the controversy stirred up by the appearance of Kenneth Chang's 2006 story in the NY Times, wherein Picard's name is mentioned.  The reason I find it necessary to do this is because some elements of Chang's story, which report claims of the DI have been blithely elevated to facthood, without benefit of a critical examination of the reported claims.

Here is my initial draft for the new section, to appear below the biography and above the discussion of the controversial DI petition.

Controversial New York Times Story

In February 2006, the New York Times ran an investigative story Few Biologists but Many Evangelicals Sign Anti-Evolution Petition by Kenneth Chang of the New York Times Science Desk, reporting that the Discovery Institute had launched a new websiteDissent From Darwin to promote their expanded public relations campaign regarding how theories of evolution should be taught in public school.  The new website included a list of signatories to an earlier petition which the Discovery Institute had termed """"A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism.""""Signatories of 'A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism' The petition dated back to 2001 when it was first published by the Discovery Institute beneath an ad criticizing a forthcoming PBS series on evolution.2001 """"100 Scientists"""" Ad]  The headline on the Discovery Institute's 2001 ad was also """"A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism,"""" although the petition itself, embedded at the bottom of the ad, did not carry that label (it bore no label at all).  The untitled 2001 version of the petition simply read, """"We are skeptical of claims for the ability of random mutation and natural selection to account for the complexity of life. Careful examination of the evidence for Darwinian theory should be encouraged."""" 

Chang's story disclosed that Professor Picard's name appeared on the petition cited by the newly launched Dissent From Darwin website, but the Times article did not distinguish which version she signed.  Indeed, Professor Picard's name first appeared on the original 2001 untitled two-sentence petition and her name remained on the subsequent controversially yclept versions, including the most recent one appearing on the new website.  Chang's story neither substantiated nor refuted the claims of the Discovery Institute that the two-sentence petition supported or endorsed DI's slant on its meaning, but the story did include a mixture of quotes from some of the people whose names appeared on the list at different times, including some quotes that cast doubt on the Discovery Institute's characterization of all the petition signers as variously """"dissenters from Darwinism"""" or """"anti-evolution.""""  Chang's story, in conjunction with the Discovery Institute's website and its attached list of petition signers left a wake of confusion over who among the list of signers of the earlier versions of the petition agreed with or consented to the Discovery Institute's characterization of the petition signers as """"anti-evolution"""" """"dissenters"""" who presumably supported the emerging and evolving agenda of the Discovery Institute.  It is at present unknown to what degree, if any, Picard agrees with or supports the Discovery Institute's controversial interpretation of the petition as """"dissent.""""  It is also unknown whether Picard has ever supported any or all of the ongoing political agenda of the Discovery Institute.

The last two sentences of the proposed new section reflect the absence of verifiable published information regarding the attitude of most of the original 103 signers.  So far, Wikipedia has only managed to obtain a reliably sourced comment from Stanley N. Salthe, who disputed DI's characterization and supplied his own salty attitude, """"A plague on both their houses.""""  

Skip Evans of the NSCE similarly casts doubt on the DI's interpretation, saying

In writing, if I have """"first serialization"""" rights and I publish a """"reprint"""" without owning the rights to """"reprint"""" or having permission from the entity that does own the rights to """"reprint,"""" I'm up a creek.

If I, as an author, sell my story as """"first serialization"""" rights to a magazine (customarily, it would be something more limited like first serialization rights for North America), then I retain all other kinds of """"first"""" rights to my story.

The distinction wouldn't matter if we were talking about Wolfowitz's or someone else's personal blog where they referred to whatever as a """"reprint."""" That would be oh, whatever, he didn't know the difference and just used the wrong word.

Contracts for stories or books are real specific about exactly what rights are going to be owned by who, and under what conditions and for how long. That specificity is why the terminology matters.

This is not Wolfowitz's personal blog. This is an encyclopedia. In a personal blog, the distinction between """"first serialization"""" and """"reprint"""" don't matter. In an encyclopedia, it does.

Hello, I was wondering if there were some users out there that could maybe assist with the expansion of this Kingdom Hearts article. I've been spending the past week trying to cite and expand sections as best I can, but I've run into a few walls that I was hoping others might be able to help with.

The development section is missing information on any actual development of the game itself. There's some info in the Kingdom Hearts (series)#Development section, but it isn't cited. If anyone can find some developer interviews about the game that could be sourced, that would help expand that section.

The manga section is missing information on the Japanese publication/serialization.

There are a few statements that I tagged as citation needed that I wasn't able to find any sources for. Admittedly, I wasn't specifically looking for those information, but nothing came up in my general searches.

I'm currently trying to find the proper in-game dialog to cite some of the information in the setting and story sections. If any body would like to help, it would be appreciated.

One last thing, if anybody can get information from or has the Kingdom Hearts Ultimania, Kingdom Hearts Ultimania Revised Edition, and/or Kingdom Hearts Series Ultimania α ~Introduction of Kingdom Hearts II~, that could help expand and source the """"Development"""" and """"Versions and merchandise"""" sections.

I'll keep trying to find information as best I can, but I'm having a hard time finding the appropriate information in English, and my Japanese is limited. Any help would of course be appreciated, but if the list above can be addressed, I think it would greatly help in getting this article to """"Good Article"""" status and hopefully eventually """"Featured Article"""" status. ( )

GameFAQs has a script and journal text. I can't help you much on the other stuff, as most of the interviews I find are only relevant to the later games and aren't sourced very well. I commend you for your efforts to make a good article.  

Thanks for the game script link, that made getting the dialog much easier than trying to transcribe it from videos. I tired to find appropriate citations and I feel that the general story is cited well-enough, but others may disagree and add as they see fit.I found a little bit of info for some things and added a reference for one item needing citation, but am still looking for the others. After looking at the Kingdom Hearts#Setting section, I think it may need a rewrite. I think the people from the peer review will say that it is too much like game-guide information instead of encyclopedic material. I'll try to paraphrase the information there in a separate edit to make any reverts easier, in case other editors are unhappy with the result. ( )
Great work overall. On """"Setting"""", I wrote that section to emulate the style of Final Fantasy VII's section, but I don't mind your complete rewrite.  

Thanks for the copy edit, I wasn't too happy with the rewrite I did, it looks better now. I edited the """"Reception"""" section to create a table of the ratings so that way they weren't just listed one after another. If others think that it takes away from the article feel free to revert it.I'm thinking of doing a rewrite of the """"Characters"""" section, the first two paragraphs read more like gameplay information. There is also no mention of the villains. I'll do it in a separate edit again, in case it doesn't turn out well. ( )
Wow, finally some work being done. Thanks, Guyinblack25, for initiating this. I've had this article on my """"To FA"""" list for some time but I never really got around to it. Anyway, I think I'm going to give it a thorough copyedit before adding new stuff.  

Thanks. Please do, because I keep finding grammar edits or weird sentences after some of the rewrites I've done, I try to remember to fix them but they slip my mind. If you're looking for new content to add, there is obviously the list above, but I also think the introduction could use some expanding if the article is to make further.

e92f0dbf4968c9ec,"""COPY OF MAIL JUST SENT TO THE WIKIEN_I LIST
In answer to the point of no legal threats - 
The legal reference was to the fact that I was
being threatened with various forms of complaint that
would need defending against, by the AFF couple, at
the same time as the block began, thus obstructing my
actions. I don't see that as a legal threat to sue
anyone. The point is one should not have personal
feuds from outside Wikipedia brought into it, and if
any harrassment that would be a wrong in the world
outside Wikipedia had been effected during the block
which it had blocked me responding to, then that
clearly would have been a legal wrong, because
Wikipedia can't opt out of the world. It is not
isolated from the existence of those factors in
society as a whole.

e.g.in the argument about Nazism that's going on here,
you are taking a position against having Nazis' target
groups put in danger, and you are doing that because
it's an outside world legal issue.

""""Wikipedia is not a democracy"""" needs quite a sharp
answer given to it. For the reason of keeping itself
in passably right relationship with the outside world,
i.e.readers, Wikipedia holds a policy on neutrality of
content. But the only way this policy genuinely exists
and is not a lie to readers, is if unconditionally
anyone who falls victim to crowd psychology can lay
claim to by right, not have to beg for by favour, any
measure that prevents a force of group numbers keeping
a bullying bias in place without having to find NPOV
ground. Now, """"laying claim to"""" anything, inherently
means being entitled to anything.

This is actually a case-study in how society emerged
from the Middle Ages. To have any credible claim to
work by any principles, a society must show they
operate reliably fairly, and to do that means that
people are entitled to it. No way out of that. Hence,
as soon as any group tries to follow any policy code
like neutral POV, immediately people are entitled to
things and all things are not dependent on favour. So,
it stands absolutely logically proved:

either * it's wrong to say to any user ever """"you'renot entitled to anything"""",

or * it's wrong to say to the public that Wikipedia has a neutrality policy that works.They can't both be right because anyone can see they contradict each other head-on. At least one must be wrong. Which is it?end of copy. Right, what this means is perfectly clear. Unless Wikipedia can answer the question I put there, """"which is it?"""", then Wikipedia is illegal. It's as simple as that, and I'm immediately posting so in every single aspie forum I belong to. I will also be asking real-life organisations to file details on it as being part of a hate campaign. The illegality is shared by every person who does not leave Wikipedia. Unless - there is an unless - unless the question is answerable. There are only 2 answers: if it's the second answer, no neutrality policy, then Wikipedia would stand obliged by its own public admission to shut down, while if it's the first answer, the mob is not in charge and people are entitled to things, then this block ends. It's as simple as that.
Now, I have a right to challenge the block and this has been the challenge. The block forms part of a group-bullying hate campaign to establish that the mob is in charge, and if that is not the case, Wikipedia has absolutely firmly no other choice than to admit that people are entitled to things, and that inherently means it is not a """"legal threat"""" to say so!!! That means being  entitled ''' to challenge any admin who claims it is. Now, people outside Wikipedia are going to see whether this has been passed on to every place for challenging blocks, and then what answers it gets.

 Charles Lindbergh, United States, who tested nazi weapons and made attacks 'against the jew lobby in United States'

Today 14 February 2006,16:27, my addings to the Rotary propaganda, used onto Wikipedia to define what is Rotary Club, were again vandalized by someone who tried to hide that Augusto Pinochet, tax frauder and one responsible of the 'missing' of 4.000 opponents in Chili, is a Rotary-honoured person, and clearly mentioned onto the Rotary fellowship official site. He removed the name of the Rotarian criminal, one of the parts of the Condor plan.

I feel that I have to add something. Please note that the temporary solution defines Kosovo as a territory of Serbia and Montenegro under UN administration. Note that it's not defined as a part of Serbia, but the Union rather. This is mostly because they anticipated the future most probable status of Kosovo, a state within the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro. 

However, you must realize that Serbia's (and the Union's) consitution defines Kosovo as an autonomous region, temporary under UN administration. The current borders of Serbia (and SCG) are internationally recognized and used everywhere (with Kosovo-Metohija). However, Kosovo is nowhere treated as an entity indistinct from Serbia (and most definatly not indistinct from the S-M), as no faction in the world sees it that way. I suggest that a possible compromise is that we should add that the Kosovar Albanian goverment refuses the Belgrade suzeiranity and considers it not a part of Serbia, and then the other side of the story (Serbia & the world), however, pointing it not an official part of Serbia and Montenegro is, francly, I apologize for the expression, but it is, really nonsensical.

In version 2, they are given the rainbow treatment, each monster appearing a different color.  Another difference is the color of the Wizard's guarding the wine cellar.

Yes, knowing something to be untrue, is generally accepted as a reason to tag or remove material.

(But then people generally add some proviso when arguing this extreme version, such as """"except when we are talking about obvious behavior issues"""".)
Trying to formulate what less extreme people think, I would say that believing something to be unlikely to be something that people could come to a consensus about being true is a valid reason for tagging or removing material.
This is perfectly consistent with our real way of working: verifiability, the ability to confirm that something is what rational people could agree to be true, is our threshold for inclusion, but not personal opinions about what is true.

eaaa9419ae541d1f,"This letter is intended as a kind of vaccine, an inoculation if you will, against the lies that permeate Amaury's jokes. The rest of this letter is focused exclusively on Amaury, not because I harbor any ill-will towards him but because he likes values that subordinate principles of fairness to less admirable criteria. Could there be a conflict of interest there? If you were to ask me, I'd say that to believe that his opinions represent the opinions of the majority—or even a plurality—is to deceive ourselves. I undeniably profess that he rewards those who show scrupulous adherence to his worldview and punishes those who make his adversarial contrivances understood, resisted, and made the object of deserved contempt by young and old alike. Deal with it.

If Amaury continues to hurt people's feelings, I will be obliged to do something about him. And you know me: I never neglect my obligations. If we can understand what has caused the current plague of vindictive despots, I believe that we can then help people see his bloody-minded epithets for what they are. Time cannot change Amaury's behavior. Time merely enlarges the field in which Amaury can, with ever-increasing intensity and thoroughness, take a condescending cheap shot at a person whom most arrogant sectarians will never be in a position to condescend to. He demands absolute and blind obedience from his encomiasts. If he didn't, they might question his orders to create a beachhead for organized warlordism. This unrelenting demand of obedience also implies that you don't need me to tell you that this is not wild speculation. This is not a conspiracy theory. This is documented fact.

This is not to say that Amaury seems to enjoy making unfounded statements and jumping to conclusions. It is merely to point out that Amaury exhibits an overweening sense of entitlement and a predilection for depreciating others. So don't feed me any phony baloney about how he has a duty to conceal the facts and lie to the rest of us, under oath if necessary, perjuring himself to help disseminate the True Faith of conspiracism. That's just not true. There is a format he should follow for his next literary endeavor. It involves a topic sentence and supporting facts. If hidebound grafters really believed in equality, they wouldn't control your bank account, your employment, your personal safety, and your mind. If you doubt this, just ask around. I'd like to end this letter with a message for Amaury. I'd like to say with emphasis and distinctness—not as a threat, but as a warning—that I will do whatever it takes to bring important information about Amaury's moonstruck, demented long-term goals into the limelight, and I won't let Amaury stop me from achieving that goal.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Dear Sir,

First, please do not email Jimmy Wales about Wikipedia issues. We have official
contact addresses for this - Jimmy just forwards misdirected emails to them and
thus contacting him simply increases delays.

We apologize for what happened.

Let me clear some misunderstanding. Wikipedia is operated by volunteers, not by
employees of Jimmy Wales or the Wikimedia Foundation. This may account for some
amount of disorganization. If you expect professional service, then, obviously,
Wikipedia cannot provide it, because it is not a professional organization.

""""Willy on Wheels"""" is/was the name of a very obnoxious user that laid waste on
Wikipedia. He kept on creating accounts with usernames based on 'willy' and 'wheels'.

Because of this, there is a de facto standing order against creating account names
based on 'willy' and 'wheels'.

The simplest solution by far is for you to take an account name that does not
include both 'willy' and 'wheels'.

Yours sincerely,
Bernard Dupre

1.  My intentions after the second ban was not to create another account using Willy and Wheels. I never told you that was what I wanted. I was confused at why I was banned from even commenting and my IP was banned.

2. I don't care what distruction this other person caused, calling someone you do not know bogus as Ohnoitsjamie did should not be tolerated. I was not and am not here to cause trouble.

3. Saying that I am here to harrass and threaten is wrong. I read your incident report. I also read the block you placed on my current IP.  I have not harrassed and I have not threatened. I simply want an apology for what I have deemed bad relations on you and Ohno's part.

4. All I want is a sincere apology for calling me bogus and accusing me of threats and harrassment and then I will go away.  If not, I will forward all messages before and from this point on to Mr. Dupre and what administrator actions need to be taken will be taken. His apology in the second line says it all.

His newest full-length under the Viking Moses moniker, the story-song cycle Crosses, is by far his most accomplished work, and ranks among the best of the newest crop of American folk recordings.

A Viking Moses show often finds Massei on his knees wailing like a man possessed.",0,0,0,0,0,0
ec05157d086edc23,"I did not ignore the hangon notice. I read your explanation and decided that it was not enough to prevent deletion. There are multiple issues with Renegade Rugby as you created it. The most obvious is that it is a clear copyright violation. We cannot ignore copyright violations just because you make a claim that you grant permission. There is no way to know if you are the copyright holder or not. To grant permission we would need the copyright holder to release the work under an appropriate license. The best way to do this would be to tag the original webpage with the license that it is being released under. We obviously can't just accept any editor's word that they are the copyright holder while a clear statement of copyright exists on the original material, if we did anyone could make such a claim for any work and we would not be able to obey the law on copyrights.

Assuming you are the copyright holder and make the change, we would still require that the text undergo major revision before it could be accepted in a Wikipedia article. In its current state it clearly does not meet our policies on maintaining a neutral point of view and its is not verifiable because it does not have any independent, published sources for the content.

It would be good to add Japanese sources to the gaming articles to expand their reception sections because the inclusion of sources from different nationalities helps to reduce systemic bias and POV. Naturally English Wikipedia will use mostly English-language sources, and naturally there are a lot of high-quality English-language RSes, and these are sufficient to demonstrate a game's notability, etc., but high-quality or major non-English and multinational sources would address Wikipedia's second pillar by reducing or eliminating cultural biases in the reporting. It sounds to me like reviews from GAMEST would be a great addition to Wikipedia for this reason.
For articles on games created in non-English-language countries, I think it's also very helpful for a full grasp of the topic to include reception from the originating culture. So in my view, reviews from Japanese sources like Famitsu or GAMEST should be used to expand the articles on Japanese games whenever possible. (And similarly, reviews from French magazines would be helpful for French games, and Russian magazines for Russian games, etc.).

 Hu12 administrator apparent libel and abuse 

Hello, this is a request to review an apparently libelous and abusive comment made about a living person at the talk page for Mount Hood, done by administrator Hu12.  Toward the bottom at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Mount_Hood#Climbing_Records

The issue stems from, as you'll see in the article's history section, my interest in adding a simple climbing record listing for Dan Howitt, with the press article references.

Hu12's post:
After going through the """"google results"""" (a disturbing education of sorts), there appears to be a long line of aliases for Dan Howitt, posting over various websites and forums promoting himself and besmirching the characters of fellow climbers and related. Appears this is an attempt to use wikipedia to import offsite conflicts and further an adjenda. It has been removed. I'd suggest that Dan Howitt read the following, Wikipedia:Wikipedia is in the real world and Law Of Unintended ConsequencesHu12

My reply:
Please remove Hu12's Libel and Vandalism above and please report this user's abuse to Wikipedia administration. Also, Hu12 of the """"google results"""" you searched most are in support of Dan Howitt, with tons of his official summit photos on Rainier, Adams, Hood, Shasta, and listings of his timing officials.

Fetal Pain (cont.)
It seems that the info in this article's Fetal Pain section is different from the information on the Fetal Pain page.  I propose changing our section to reflect what is on the fetal pain page.  The following is taken from the fetal pain page directly (though edited for summary form):

Fetal pain, its existence, and its implications are debated politically and academically, particularly in regards to the abortion debate.  

A 2005 American study, conducted by neurobiologists and pediatricians concluded that """"...fetal perception of pain is unlikely before the third trimester. Little or no evidence addresses the effectiveness of direct fetal anesthetic or analgesic techniques.""""""""Fetal Pain: A Systematic Multidisciplinary Review of the Evidence"""" JAMA. 2005;294:947-954. Susan J. Lee, JD; Henry J. Peter Ralston, MD; Eleanor A. Drey, MD, EdM; John Colin Partridge, MD, MPH; Mark A. Rosen, MD  With the encouragement of President Ronald Reagan, in 1984 a small group of physicians argued that the ability of a fetus to feel pain appears as early as seven weeks after conception.Robinson, B.A. (2006). Can a fetus feel pain?. Ontario Consultants for Religious Tolerance. Retrieved December 14, 2005.  Most medical researchers agree pain cannot be felt until the third trimester of pregnancy or until after birth.""""Study: Fetus feels no pain until third trimester"""" MSNBC

There may be an """"emerging consensus among developmental neurobiologists that the establishment of thalamocortical connections"""" (at about 26 weeks) is a critical event with regard to fetal perception of pain.  Nevertheless, because pain can involve sensory, emotional and cognitive factors, it is """"impossible to know"""" when painful experiences may become possible, even if it is known when thalamocortical connections are established.Johnson, Martin and Everitt, Barry.  Essential reproduction (Blackwell 2000): """"The multidimensionality of pain perception, involving sensory, emotional, and cognitive factors may in itself be the basis of conscious, painful experience, but it will remain difficult to attribute this to a fetus at any particular developmental age.""""  Retrieved 2007-02-21.  According to Arthur Caplan, """"there is no consensus among the medical and scientific experts about precisely when a fetus becomes pain-capable.  Some put the point at 28 weeks. Others say 26 or 24 and still others younger still.""""Caplan, Arthur.

Speedy deletion of Greymatter
 A tag has been placed on Greymatter requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section G12 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be a blatant copyright infringement. For legal reasons, we cannot accept copyrighted text or images borrowed from other web sites or printed material, and as a consequence, your addition will most likely be deleted. You may use external websites as a source of information, but not as a source of sentences. This part is crucial: say it in your own words.

If the external website belongs to you, and you want to allow Wikipedia to use the text — which means allowing other people to modify it — then you must include on the external site the statement """"I, (name), am the author of this article, (article name), and I release its content under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2 and later."""" You might want to look at Wikipedia's policies and guidelines for more details, or ask a question here. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.

To say that they approached the topic with skepticism is to imply that they literally considered the possibility that this truly was a time traveler. That itself is a POV. I disagree and say that the reporters and anchors who reported the story were well aware that this was a joke and that debunking it was simply part of the satire. """"Debunking"""" a time traveler is POV. And if it is satire it is clearly intentional unreliability. Reporting what something appears to be is a pseudoscience. Every year many news sources have """"Special Issues"""" on April 1st. There is an understanding that on that date many pranks may be pulled. We laugh and then forget the jokes the next day, in my opinion. Orson Welles' """"War of the Worlds"""" broadcast is notable because (amongst other things) of the widespread panic that it caused by people who literally believed it to be a reliable news item. I don't think that any of these people """"went along with the fun, wink wink, nudge nudge, and fled their homes just for the snicker bragging rights"""". No such notable hysteria came of this story, as I had already shown that since the initial flash in the pan 2 months ago this has been mentioned only once by any news source. Charlie Chaplin's The Circus is not the point, it never has been. The point is seeing how far a joke can be stretched for the snickering fun of it. The Circus, or a few seconds from an extra feature on its DVD over 80 years after it was made, its itself arbitrary to the joke itself. How then does this help the wikipedia article for The Circus? -   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Pullback of Sections vs. Pullback of Bundles 

Actually, there is a subtle point that this article gets wrong, and in fact many books get wrong (or fail to emphasize, although I believe it's because everyone learns it this way). Yes, I know that if it is wrong, I could just update it myself; but it looks like this will require a bit of rearrangement which I'm not quite in the mood to sort out now, and so it is best for me to give a brief statement of the issue here. It's also way past my bedtime, so, if anyone wants to help out while I'm sleeping, be my guest.

The problem is a terminological confusion which arises from using the term pullback for different (but related) things. For f  M → N a smooth map, there is usually not a smooth bundle map from T*N to T*M (unless f is a diffeomorphism). There is a pointwise map of individual cotangent spaces f*p  Tf(p) N → Tp M for every p, defined by operation with the pushforward of a vector in the corresponding tangent space (it is the transpose of the pushfoward on individual tangent spaces). But for the general point q in N we can't pull back to M unless we have a way of choosing a point in f-1(q) (which is especially problematic if f is not onto...). However, we can pull back sections of the cotangent bundle (i.e. covector field, and this applies in general to covariant tensor fields). The """"pullback"""" everyone talks about is a map from covector fields on N to covector fields on M, that is, given ω: N → T*N a section, we define f*ω  M → T*M  by

where f*p is just the pointwise pullback defined before. This is always well-defined. Note that this is just the opposite of the problem with vectors and their fields (and in general, contravariant tensor fields): in that case, there is a pushforward which is a smooth bundle map of the tangent bundles, but in general vector field does not push forward unless the map is a diffeomorphism. It has been remarked in several books that the co-objects seem to have this wonderful extra structure, of being able to pull back sections. What really happened is that it gave up the capability to induce a smooth bundle map of the bundles in the process, thus restoring one aspect of """"duality"""" that seems to have been broken when dealing with this subject.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

""""And a couple more texts are required if you study quantum theory related to those subjects"""" Quantum theory started by a German Max Planck, but nobody knew its real mathematical background therefore it remained just a semi-science, until a Hungarian János Neumann made it. Lot of famous scientist of the era tried to made the mathematical background of the Q.theory but its proved to difficult for them. Neumann redefinied the definitions, he pointed out serials of former serious errors. He made Q. theory to a calculable science which made it a practicable science for industry. He invented the famous game theory and designed the world-famous ENIAC digital computer too.(ENIAC, short for Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer,[1][2] was the first general-purpose electronic computer. It was a Turing-complete, digital computer capable of being reprogrammed to solve a full range of computing problems.[3] ENIAC was designed to calculate artillery firing tables for the U.S. Army's Ballistic Research Laboratory, but its first use was in calculations for the hydrogen bomb. When ENIAC was announced in 1946 it was heralded in the press as a """"Giant Brain"""". It boasted speeds one thousand times faster than electro-mechanical machines, a leap in computing power that no single machine has since matched. This mathematical power, coupled with general-purpose programmability, excited scientists and industrialists.) Neumann was the main mathematican in Manhattan Project. Other famous Hungarian was Jenő Wigner often reffered as the father of quantum mechanics. Other famous Hungarian: Leó Szilárd his invention changed the basis of nuclear science:  he invented the nuclear chain reaction and invented the nuclear reactor (and he invented with Wigner the first nuclear power station) as well as the first Particle accelerator. Therefore the nuclear physics became a practicable/utilizable science for mankind. As the inventor nuclear chain reaction, he realised foremost the atomic-bomb, he made the basic """"Cutaway Drawing"""" of the first atomic bomb. He asked Albert Einstein to write letter to president Roosevelt for the realization of a concrete nuclear Bomb. In Manhattan project dosens of scientist and hundreds of engineers worked for the realization of Szilárd's idea: a working atomic bomb from 1939-1944. An other Hungarian Ede Teller invented the H-bomb. And it is just particle quantum / nuclear physics. It is just a branch of physics.  We had dosens of similar great scientists in other branchs of the physics and natural sciences.
The exaggeratedly anglocentric Rico have never heard about these scientists. The expert historians of natural sciences are always shocked about great number of Hungarian scientists, how is it possible for such a little country.

 _/|\_I don't know why the Removed Features section claims that the classic start menu and taskbar will be
 removed. Nor do I know why the Inkball game is supposedly removed. This section cites no references and these
 claims are the most questionable.  

I'm not sure as the the reasons as to why they we're removed but I can tell you that Ink Ball is not found anywhere in the beta release, I'm not sure about the classic start menu and taskbar, i don't see an option for them but I didn't look all that hard   

 Inkball only appears in Tablet Edition windows products.  Is there a tablet addition of the Windows 7 beta?   
 Hmm... I may be wrong there.  The article mentions that it also appeared in Vista Home Edition.  Still, Can't imagine it's very fun with a mouse.   
It does indeed come with Vista Home Premium, not sure about other editions.   
It also comes with Ultimate. But anyway, mentioning it has been removed if the only evidence we have is it's not included in the current beta is an incredibly bad idea. We need a reliable source saying Microsoft has decided to remove it. There could be plenty of reasons why it's not in beta, only one of them is Microsoft has decided to remove it completely

 non-NPOV + inaccurate information 

Regarding the piece of text """"Since most of those hadith are on the authority of Abu Huraira, most Shia dismiss them as a sad examples of what happens when all Sahaba are counted as trustworthy: A clear breach in Tawhid, the belief that God is above its creation.""""

Reasons for removal:

 Abu Huraira is one of the most prolific muhaddithin and a source of many of the sahih hadith. 

 The phrase """"most shia"""" does not cite any authority or text and could therefore be completely fabricated. Not to mention that there are over a dozen subsects among the shi`a.

 """"sad examples of what happens"""" <- that's a non-NPOV (non-Neutral Point Of View)

Oddly enough, I am truly agnostic on this particular bit of software. It's always been my position that it should have a fair trial, but it seems that at every step things have been problematic.  First off, there was the fact it was introduced immediately on the heels of two other major UI changes (the addition of revision deletion to the admin toolkit, and the switchover to Vector).  Then there was the fact that the version on the test wiki was *not* the version to be introduced here, so nobody could even test it properly on the testwiki.  The trial criteria were not developed until just days before the trial itself, and there were no benchmarks set to determine whether or not there was any change over time, or whether that change was positive or negative. The majority of early supporters in the original PC poll wanted it to be focused on BLPs, but for some reason at the end of the poll it was decided that PC should be applied to currently protected or semi-protected articles instead, and those were the articles targeted in the trial. The WMF press on the subject specifically referred to the ability for anonymous and newly-registered users to edit long-time semi-protected articles of high profile topics (the George W. Bush article was specifically mentioned), without discussing this in advance with the community. (It lasted less than 2 days on pending changes, with mountains of vandalism during that period.) Then there was the promise by the lead developer that PC would be shut off at the end of 60 days unless the community clearly requested otherwise. Four days later, when lead developer responsibility changed hands, the new lead developer announced that he would rather keep things running during any review, on a quiet page with only the most interested editors watching.  Even with all of this disarray, I still hoped that we could get a reasonable trial of the tool. It was agreed that we'd start off with 2000 articles in the trial, starting with just a few and ramping up so that we'd hit the 2K articles around 2 weeks into the trial, with the expectation that if things went well, we'd add more incrementally, perhaps up to 10K; however, only a handful of administrators participated in adding articles to the trial, and I don't think we ever got above 1500.  Further, at that point, we'd pretty well added all of the articles that were eligible under the criteria for the trial, except for ones in categories where one or more administrator had objected to inclusion; as best I can tell, their objections were based on the articles being honey pots for socks.  I was one of the most active admins in adding articles to the trial, and I confess I sneaked in a pile of BLPs that technically didn't meet the criteria (they had been semi-protected in the previous 6 months and had fewer than 10 watchers). Indeed, one of the most telling factors on this trial was the fact that very, very few administrators appeared to be interested in using the tool as currently configured. I also note that the time that it has taken edits to be reviewed has continued to lengthen as time has gone on. A few weeks ago, I led a panel on the topic of Pending changes at the New York City Wiki-conference. Thanks to DGG, Becksguy and Jamesofur, who were also on the panel.   That same day, keynote speaker Clay Shirky talked about the fact that once a culture is """"broken"""", it is not able to rebound back to its prior state. In my own closing statement, I reflected on that comment, and wondered if pending changes might be the """"culture-breaker"""" for Wikipedia and, if it was, whether or not that would be a good or bad thing. Certainly the manner in which this entire trial has proceeded has shown that there are some pretty huge differences in what people perceive as the way we do things around here. I don't think  the pending changes software or its use will be the culture breaker, but the manner in which it is being integrated and promoted into the project might very well be. I am very considerably concerned that this pressure to keep a bit of trial software running has resulted in a level of divisiveness between good-faith Wikipedians from which the community may not recover.

Again, I don't think this is productive, but I'll make my position clear anyway. Oppose. There are some sources here that support the idea that various types of nuclear power have been considered as sustainable, but that wasn't the only reason the IPs edits were reverted. This is one reason tying this into the above discussion is a bad idea, because this isn't just about the academic consensus on a loosely defined """"type of nuclear fission"""". Using the article to explain in context that nuclear power is in some ways sustainable, according to some points of view, would be fine. The edits introduced large quantities relatively weakly sourced material to present nuclear as being a primary and uncontroversial source of sustainable energy. The above sources support mentioning nuclear as one aspect of sustainability. They do not warrant altering the article to make nuclear energy the first specific section, nor do they warrant excessive ref-bombing to support that perspective, while using similarly selective tactics to undermine those who hold a more critical perspective. This isn't just about verifiability, this is also about WP:WEIGHT. Even the sources presented here indicate that nuclear's sustainability is under-researched and hinges on too many unknowns to be accepted without further comment. This is true for many areas of sustainable energy research, but especially nuclear. It is an active area of research (or areas, rather) which has a relatively small but extremely vocal core of active supporters. This should not be used to diminish that perspective or the potentially revolutionary research, but major context was being selectively left-out from the proposed edits.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Nits and Appreciation from Robert Steele

1)  Second ranking civilian:  at the time there were about 25 civilians in Marine Corps intelligence.  The top person was John Guenther, an SES-6 who had been there forever.  I was the second, as a GM-14.  All others were GS-09 to GS-13.  It is an accurate fact.

2)  On the Drug War film, I did not volunteer.  The film producer got in touch with me because of my Amazon reviews, eg. LOST HISTORY on contras, drugs, and CIA, and asked if I could come to Los Angeles for filming.  I agreed provided he would pay my expenses, which he did, and I volunteered my time.

3)  The COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE book is my first book to be published that does not have my name on the cover.  I am turning now toward nurturing and aggregating others and although I have three chapters in this book, recommend it be listed.

If anyone wants to engage in dialog leading to improvements of this page (for example, my three most recent seminal articles on OSINT are at www.oss.net/OSINT-S, www.oss.net/OSINT-O, and at www.oss.net/HILL where my article on """"The Open Source Program: Missing in Action"""" is being read by virtually everyone either planning to attend or deciding not to attend the DNI OSINT conference

I also wrote the Joint Military Intelligence Training Center Open Source Handbook, and the Special Operations Forces Open Source Handbook, as well as the NATO Open Source Handbook, and will create stubs for the first two, should anyone wish to link to them.

efa6836dcc6a97d5,"Topic ban violation and sock puppetry
Hello. You had some interaction with IP  in connection with the Golan Heights  so accordingly, I am notifying you and Stifle of a matter that is of serious concern.
 
I have reason to believe that this IP user is Nableezy trying to circumvent a topic ban imposed on him by Stifle. The ban forbids him from editing or commenting on the Golan Heights and all areas of Israel and its environs including cities, settlements and regions.
 
The IP in question geolocates to Chicago  and the edit in question is consistent with Nableezy’s POV.  Prior to the instant edits, the IP never made any edits to the topic area and the first edit that he makes in the topic area is to The Golan Heights. 

Nableezy is also from Chicago as evidenced from his early Trait Page
 
But there is more. The subject IP also made edits to a hockey article involving players in the NHL. Nableezy has expressed more than a passing interest for this subject as evidenced by this 
 
But the similarities between the IP user and nableezy do not end there. The subject IP made this edit on a very technical subject involving circuitry and electronics. 
 
Nableezy attended Illinois Institute of Technology, a school that emphasizes engineering and IT evidenced by his early Trait List 
 
So now we have an IP who, like Nableezy, comes from Chicago with interests in the Golan Heights, Hockey and IT. The coincidences are too great to ignore per WP:DUCK. The evidence suggests that The IP is Nableezy's sock puppet used to circumvent Stifle's topic ban.",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Hi Peter, I'll look into this bug shortly. I will run a trace of your classifications and see if, indeed, some of the revisions do show up twice. This is pretty core functionality for something to go wrong and unnoticed for so long  although maybe it is specific to the WikiTrust queue  which does not see a lot of use. This is the user-name you were using? And you logged in with the same user-name both times, right?
 Can you describe what the scrolling issue is? I fret this could be a tougher fix  its not like I actually implement scrolling, this is just something Java provides. 
 Also, you'll generally find that the accuracy of classifications among the queues looks like """"Cluebot-NG > STiki > WikiTrust"""" (assuming everything is working correctly). This is of course, is dependent on a complex set of criteria, how many people have been using a particular queue lately, etc.

Her mother is a professional and has worked for the government for almost 30 years and her father is retired.   Traci was raised on staage at the age of 2 starting with ballet then tap, then jazz.... she was a natural on stage..... throughout her childhood she was in pagaents and sport like softball, volleyball and track in high school, she competed in many events: Miss Wright State of OHIO,All American Drill Team.

After Traci graduated, her love of dance and people took her to a business college, where she studied basics in business management.  Then she learned ins and outs of banking and later took on another degree in Medical Techology. She also did promotional work for , bartended , ran local bars and competed in bikini contests for extra funds.

In 1996, Traci started lifting weights with a friend and saw a photo of Marla Duncan winning a national competition. Her beauty and physique impressed her enough that she wanted to try what she was doing - Fitness Competitions. At the time she was developing some problems medically and noticed herself gaining some weight.   Traci thought weight training would help but she found that because she is a natural she responded almost imediately to the weights which caused her to get pretty stocky and very strong quick.  She was still eating normally but when it comes to bikini contests you need to be lean and feminine.... well this is when the Army Soldiers took a noticed to her.  She was at Ft. Hood, TX and was left alone because a lot of times soldiers are away for months to years and she was pretty shy meeting others because she had always been very much independent.  So she decided to check out while in studies some competitions related to the Army.  This is where she found out about obstacles course contests... so she knew she was strong and stocky so maybe this would be better for her.  So she entered her first WTF competition with little or know training and out of 100 girls made nationals in top 10. but something happened ... she started noticing her weight wasn't changing and she was developing back problems and fatigue.   She had always had problems with being healthy as a kid and seemed to get sick a lot.  Her Father was always on her about bundling up.  One day her discomfort and taken so much that she ended up in the emergency room... this is when she found that her bowels had backed up into her system and she was lucky because if was really serious... the only time she had ever dealt with hospitals is with her hearing... she had lost her hearing at four along with being sick all the time... and at 17 had to have implants put in which was a miracle cause it gave her 80% back... but she is still considered hearing impaired... now this is happening to her... she had gained a weight up to 180 and looked very stocky... the doctors didn't know what was wrong with her.... she spent three days being detoxed so to speak... when they didn't know if she had lupus, rheumatoid, but later found traces of cancer in her colon... but she didn't let it get her down. So she reenrolled in school again for more college degrees towards nutrition in NC.   Up until 2002 she only competed for fun, not as a money making career. In 2002 she was honored with several titles in many organizations like Hawaiian Tropic, Venus, Ms Fitness and Sport Aerobics and WTF.. it wasn't til she had heard she was on ESPN2 every month for one year and honored on the front page of her local newspaper and found herself in several articles in OXYGEN. This helped Traci realize that she had potential to earn some actual money in the fitness industry. She kept competing and in April of '2002 moved to an organization which she had heard was tough and very different from others called NPC /IFBB.  This is where Arnold S. Slyvester Stalone and many more came out of you know the BOYS CLUB Once she arrived, competing in her first NPC she had found a very different way they handled threi shows and treated the competitors... Shoop coming from a strong female in charge background family life saw that this was going to be a challenge for her... she had dreamed of maybe getting more exposure and getting the chance to really be friends with some of the hollywood celebrities.  During the time she was studying nutriiton she always had more than several ideas and projects in mind to bring to the future.... now she has alwsy felt competing natural was always her best route and found with no help and little support she was able to conquer her enemies and achieve her goals.  She was always wnadering why thes other girls who seemed to get covers and major sponsors did it... where she found herself funding everything on her little $7 an hour because she as a military spouse never made as much in those cities because the husband was the provider she was tired of the little she wanted bigger she knew that s",0,0,0,0,0,0

 To be honest, I think that this is a fair comment. Accordingly, (and as this is a much debated article), I would like to propose this revised opening paragraph:
The terms Old Style (or O.S.) and New Style (or N.S.) are used in English language historical studies to indicate that the dating system used in the source material is one or other of the (historic) methods for determining the day on which the year starts. In the Old Style dating, the year began on 25 March, whereas in the New Style it began on 1 January.Death warrant of Charles I web page of the UK National Archives A demonstration of New Style meaning Julian calendar with a start of year adjustment. Additionally (more so in other parts of the world), the terms are used to indicate the change from the historic calendar [for example, the Julian calendar in Europe and the Americas] to the (modern) Gregorian calendar.The October (November) Revolution Britannica encyclopaedia, A demonstration of New Style meaning the Gregorian calendar.Stockton, J.R.

I believe that, properly and historically, the 'Styles' really refer only to the 'Start of Year' change (from March 25th to January 1); and that the 'Leap Year'  change should be described as the change from Julian to Gregorian.""""Spathaky, Mike Old Style New Style dates and the change to the Gregorian calendar.

We as historians have no excuse for creating ambiguity and must keep to the notation described above in one of its forms. It is no good writing simply 20th January 1745, for a reader is left wondering whether we have used the Old or the New Style reckoning. The date should either be written 20th January 1745 O.S. (if indeed it was Old Style) or as 20th January 1745/6. The hyphen (1745-6) is best avoided as it can be interpreted as indicating a period of time.""""

 VfD on Jews by country 

This has not yet been submitted, and John would wig out if I submitted it myself. But I suggest you discuss this with others ASAP. I submit for your discussion with others that the author has little regard for misrepresenting the reliability of his figures, that the article gives a inferior knowledge than the Jewish population article does both of current and pass population tends. That the title is questionable in its honesty because as he shows at the top of the discussion page, following his prevuious pattern he should have used the less offensive title Judaism by country. And finally, the figures which he has published do not come from the listed reference pages as he infers but have been generated by himself by multiplying the est. 2005 populations by the rough percentage numbers for the countries.

As an example, being Australian I checked his figure for """"Australian Jews"""" in his words. None of his references give his figure of 100,452. Nor do any of the reputable sources pretend to give percise religious numbers to six or eight digit accuracy. In fact, checking the references you quickly discover that the 2001 Australian census gave the figure of 84,000 people who marked Judaism as their religion. That all other real estimates are based upon adjustments to that figure, as is discussed on this page I found by a Christian Research Association. I finally did a Google searchon his claimed figure to discover that Wikipedia is the only publication claiming such a figure. So I finally submit that this article relects badly upon Wikipedia and adds no meaningful value beyond the fine work already done in Jewish population. I am afraid this is seems to be another example of where this author has misrepresented certain details to create the illusion that he is scholarly NPOV author. 17:32, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)""",0,0,0,0,0,0

As Whitehouse observes, """"Wikipedia's strength is that it has thousands of eyes looking at it. The hope is that errors will be quickly caught and corrected."""".. Marketing professor Peter Fader notes that Wikipedia shows there is wisdom in crowds, but a better user rating system would filter out those who post bogus information. Joel Waldfogel, professor of business and public policy, agrees that much of the concern about Wikipedia is just a new spin on whether old media (printed encyclopedias, in this case) stand a chance against the new breed of instantly updatable online media. (quoted from article). In short, no matter what system you come up with here, it is going to be wisdom of the crowd, by design, that is what Wiki is. So you might as well design a system around that concept, go with the natural design of the system, work with it to all its advantages, not work against it and try to limit it with """"old media"""" concepts.

I reverted the change you made to Conservatism, following the undiscussed removal of the POV tag I had placed there. I object to the changes you made based on weight issues. The main article is substantially different in tone and weight, and associating conservatism with """" ... the plantation system and slavery ... """" and """" ... skeptics toward reason and science ... """" lacks any semblance of neutrality in such a small section. Additionally, you made the change to the section with the comment, """"Replace a statement that says almost exactly the opposite of what the cited source says with quotations from the cited source"""". Can you please provide specific page numbers from the source? Barry Clark is a supporter of the """"occupy"""" movement and has strong feelings about the US economy, but such an inflammatory statement still needs specific cites.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

I could be wrong here, but in Hitman: Blood Money, in that last cut-scene, just before Diana enters his hideout, the article assumes 47 kills the canary by snapping his neck. However, since this is done off screen, and also the canary is caged, my assumption was that 47 snapped his fingers and the canary stopped chirping.  This would seem to fit in with the fact that 47 takes care to take the cage with him out of harm's way when he hears someone coming.

Um, the Georg Blume quote obviously implies that he was inquiring about the reason for the riots. James Miles was there to report on the riots, so he would ask questions pertaining to the riots. If they actually wanted to separate, I can tell you right now that, logically, they would've TOLD THEM they wanted to and would say something to the effect of """"FREE US, WE WANT TO SEPARATE"""", but they did not. They just explained their issues, which were socioeconomic and ethnic issues. In addition, James Miles states: """"The rioting seemed primarily an eruption of ethnic hatred."""",which I'm guessing he had to interview many rioters/residents to ask them about it. And rather, I don't think the Rodney King article is worded very well- it should be changed, but I'm guessing many people are already well-informed of the real reasons for those riots, unlike this riot where few seem to understand- including you! And, come on now, you're obviously just picking at straws to try to twist the article. All evidence so far points to the rioters looting and beating ethnic Han chinese out of hatred, not because they want to separate or they would've attacked much more government buildings rathern than focussing on the stores of more wealthy Chinese people. Right now, the article is pretty neutral as it already explains both sides and I hope people keep it this way.216.252.71.154

Dear Ronz,

PSB the embedded links and the areas which I am trying to update: 

1. The multi-stage fitness test, also known as the bleep test, beep test, pacer test, Leger-test or 20-m shuttle run test, is used by sports coaches and trainers to estimate an athlete's VO2 max (maximum oxygen uptake). The test is especially useful for players of sports like rugby, soccer, Australian rules football, hockey, netball, handball, tennis, squash and fitness testing at schools and colleges plus many other sports; employed by many international sporting teams as an accurate test of Cardiovascular fitness, one of the all-important """"Components of Fitness"""". This test is also part of the FITNESSGRAM - Commercial Link, incorrect and unrelated to the Multi-stage Fitness Test physical fitness test to measure cardiorespiratory - Typo fitness. The test was created by Luc Leger, University of Montreal[1] published in 1983, """"A Maximal Multistage 20m Shuttle Run Test to predict VO2 Max"""", and was re-published in the European Journal of Applied Physiology (vol 49 pp 1–12) in 1988 in its present form with 1 min stages under the name """"Multistage 20-m shuttle run test for aerobic fitness"""".[2] Result equivalences between slightly modified versions are well explained by Tomkinson et al. in 2003.[3] The beep test world record is 19.2, held by Håkan Mild.[4][unreliable source?] - Embedded Commercial Link LAZYRUNNER added as Reference

2. The Multi-stage Fitness Test is know as both the beep test and bleep test, the broken links for the beep article are irrelevant to the content of the Multi-stage Fitness Test article as it discusses both.

I look forward to hearing from you via PM.

Two people of this opinion (one other) are required before a Request for Comment on her actions can be made.

This is a complaint relating to the conduct of Administrator Gwen Gale with specific reference to her summary deletion of the section labelled “Criticism” in the Alex Jones Talk Show Host page on 15 March 2009.

Her most substantive comments relating to the summary deletion were as follows  
“single source cited says it's not clear what even happened”
I've removed it following WP:BLP and WP:WEIGHT, given the single cited source says it's not even clear what happened, it's nothing but a non-notable, second-hand anecdote about what may or may not have been a parking lot brawl. Gwen Gale (talk) 
The grounds (as you put it) are WP:BLP. Gwen Gale (talk)  

The complaint is based on five points 
1/ Gwen Gale failed to follow proper policy with regard to deleting biographical material on living persons, viz. discussing it beforehand. The section had existed for some time, had been discussed and commented on extensively, and had been edited by several persons. As far as I am aware, Gwen Gale had no prior involvement in the page or the section concerned. Certainly, I had never seen her name in any of the page history. Unless it constituted a grave breach of some other policy, which not even Gwen Gale has claimed, any possible deletion should have been discussed beforehand and not executed summarily. To quote the BLP policy  “Biographical material about a living individual that is not compliant with this policy should be improved and rectified; if this is not possible, then it should be removed.”
No complaint about the nature of the material was made beforehand; no opportunity for improvement or rectification was offered. 
2/ Having failed to discuss it properly beforehand, Gwen Gale also failed to discuss it properly afterwards. She made a few general remarks, using terms which, as will be discussed later, do not form part of any Wikipedia policy, viz. “single sourced, anecdotal”, and breezily referred those who wanted to discuss the matter with her to general Wikipedia policy documents, such as Biography of Living Persons or Verifiability. As will be shown in what follows the text did not violate either of these policy documents. Gwen Gale refused multiple specific requests to quote the exact passages of the Biography on Living Persons or Verifiability policies which she claimed had been violated. This refusal to properly discuss a summary deletion is against Wikipedia conduct guidelines and not acceptable behaviour in an Administator.
3/ Gwen Gale’s comments on the summary deletion reveal that she does not understand the core Wikipedia policy on reliable sources.
4/ Gwen Gale’s comments indicate that she does not understand the proper scope of Wikipedia’s policy on Verifiability.
5/ Gwen Gale’s comments reveal that she does not understand Wikipedia’s Biography on Living Persons policy. 
The only serious grounds on which deletion of the deleted text could be justified is Weight. This is not the ground on which Gwen Gale chose to defend it. She repeatedly cited BLP and V as the core defence of her actions, demonstrating that her judgement is massively flawed and that her administrative powers should be revoked. The core issue here is not the content. The core issue is Gwen Gale’s conduct and judgement. The Weight issue will, however, be discussed at the end.

Gwen Gale’s Misunderstanding of the Wikipedia’s Guidelines on Reliable Sourcing
It is clear that Gwen Gale does not understand Wikipedia’s policy on sourcing. In stating that the claims embodied in the deleted text were “anecdotal”, she is effectively second-guessing the judgement of the original reliable source, viz. The Austin Chronicle. She is implicitly expressing the view that the Austin Chronicle’s assembled journalists, editors, sub-editors and lawyers made an error in judgement in publishing the article in the first place. This is completely unacceptable and represents a FUNDAMENTAL ERROR IN JUDGEMENT. It is in no way appropriate for Wikipedia editors to make their own subjective judgements about the editorial standards of highly reputable and professional publications. It is the equivalent of an editor disputing a reference to a professional academic journal on",0,0,0,0,0,0

Re-ill's mindset, """"I'm in a place in my life where I need to become who I am... I got to “Get It”!!! says E. Re-ill. “Get It” is an album that when focused on can bring out the drive in you to make your dreams real. Why you may ask? You need three things to achieve your goals Hope (expectations), Hustle (drive) and Hunger (appetite for success). These three mindsets are displayed in this album which accompanied by your dreams this will enable your inner being to ““Get It”!” E. Re-ill has been producing beats since the late 80's, influenced by Dr. Dre (and who isn't), Rick Rubin, performed with many stars, and has participated in great projects. A prior and classic venture was with the street-ball company Y.P.A. and the DVD titled """"The War"""". E. Re-ills’ most rememberable time in making music is when N.W.A. was filming the classic controversial video """"Straight Outta Compton"""" E. Re-ill's older brother caught the attention of Ice Cube and filmed Ice Cube telling E. Re-ill to keep up and he'll see him on top!!! That statement would drive E.Re-ill for many years. Hip-Hop has always been the “in touch with your inner voice” music and then we have always informed our community of how we see the actions displayed in front of us. Hip-Hop can be fun, dark, and everything in between. However, usually no matter the topic a hip-hop song it should captivate you!!! “Get It” is no exception to this, “Get It” displays emotional drive, creative sound packages, consistent vibe and sounds, and arguably some of the best lyrics delivered on hip-hop tracks in a long while. Songs like """"Dark People"""" a description of pushing your self to great heights even when life shorts you of opportunities. """"I'm So Gangsta"""" is a nice surprise!!!

Oakland native and a brilliant lyricist Fresh Caesar (a.k.a. Omega) is currently working on his own album titled """"Jack London’s Square"""". Fresh Caesar displays lyrical strengths of Nas and Jay-Z with a west coast flavor delivery. Fresh Caesar displays great lyrical ability and is definitely not your average rapper on the mic. Down South/Oakland rapper, Tom-E-Gunn has the sounds of Snoop Dogg's early gangsta swag with grit of the south. These songs are actually lost demos recently found. E. Re-ill felt compelled to use the demos for the world to hear due to their strong delivery of life experiences. E. Re-ill's “Get It” album is about all the aspirations that we desire in life money, success, respect, reflections of life, and excess of women and parties.

I believe that the Clean Air Act trial is deserving of a separate section, given the potential enormous exposure that BP has and the fact that this trial will be ongoing, generating headlines, through next year. Some editors have stated in edit summaries that this paragraph is """"soapboxing,"""" but I don't think that it is. The trial, which has received extensive cover in the media, deals with issues for which BP has already pleaded guilty, and faces fine of up to $20 billion. The presence of other articles is immaterial. This is a very serious trial, and it behooves us to mention it to readers, and state what is at stake. Failure to do so would be a serious NPOV violation, as is the fact that the legal jeopardy that BP faces is not mentioned in the article thanks to the recent edits, an I have so tagged the article.

On the figure, the BP Corporate editor monitoring the article on the talk page here has indicated that other sourcing states that the actual figure of BP's exposure from this trial is really $17 billion, not $ 20 billion. If that can be verified, the figure can be adjusted, but first we need to deal with whether we are going to deal with this in the article at all. Right now we are in the extraordinary position of an article on BP not stating that the U.S. Justice Department is seeking maximal penalties in the billions concerning an issue in which BP has already pleaded guilty to criminal charges.

I copy this from comfort women pages. It contains many references.

Why Korean comfort women during Korean War and why Korean collaborators? Because it is true. It all happened and it was all discuss probably before you were born. So we look to the academics and newspapers for reference.

From, The Construction of US Camptown Prostitution in South Korea: Transformation and Resistance by Lee, Na Young, 2006
 
'The term “comfort women” (wianbu) to refer to military prostitutes serving American soldiers signals the widespread acceptance of camptown prostitution as an inevitable means to entertain foreign soldiers. This term was commonly used in newspaper articles throughout the 1950s along with such phrases as “prostitutes catering to UN soldiers” and terms like yanggongju (Western princesses), or “UN madams” (woman getting a livelihood by serving UN soldiers).129 This usage continued during the 1960s and 1970s when camptown prostitution became more differentiated from non-U.S. military prostitution.  The Korean government’s policy on prostitution reflected its public’s perspectives on prostitution, which was, in the decades after the war, regarded as a necessary means to feed Korea’s impoverished population.'

The Chosun Ilbo or Daily News is major newspapers in South Korea 2,200,000 readers. Examples given are in Chosun Ilbo 23 August, 1960, it mentions, """"In Pup’yLng, some 150 'comfort women dealing with American troops'. Similar reports using the words """"comfort women"""" are: KyLnghyang Ilbo, 11/25/1955; Chosun ilbo, 11/08/1957; Chosun ilbo, 8/23/1960; Chosun ilbo, 12/03/1963. A “Comfort Women’s demonstration” is also reported in 1966. 

In the mid- to late-1960s, there were numerous articles in Chosun ilbo reporting crimes committed against camptown prostitutes by American soldiers that continued to used the term 'comfort women'. Korea college girls recruited for the Nangnang Club were also viewed as """"yanggongju"""" or comfort women (Seoul Sinmun 26 July, 1952; 10 October, 1953). Post-war military brothels were still known as comfort stations and the system based on the Japanese one.

In 1958, the Chosun ilbo also accounts for the number of women involved as 300,000. The women who served “one American husband” were called “yangbuin” (Western madam) instead of the usual """"yanggalbo"""" (western whore) who were generally treated by Korean society as “non-human beings”. Generally, the Yanggongju have been ignored in official Korean histories as a national shame until recent. 

Song-gun Chong in 1967 wrote, 3,000 so-called “comfort women” registered with the  Health Section of the Military and the Military Police Corps of the U.S. Army (“Current Situations of Korean Prostitutes and Countermeasures.” Pophak-nonchong 8:65-87.) 

You can download the main reference at http://www.lib.umd.edu/drum/bitstream/1903/4162/1/umi-umd-3959.pdf

References also arise in Yi, Imha. 2004a. The Korean War and Gende (Hankuk Chonjaengkwa Jaendo). Seoul: Sohaemunjip.

Have you seen The Women Outside: Korean Women and the U.S. Military. Directors J.T. Takagi and Hye Jung Park. 1995. 60 minutes. VHS?

Many of Korean women were also forced, tricked, financial compromised or even kidnapped into sexual slavery for American troops in South Korea. As example, the documentary features Yang Hyang Kim, who """"applied for a job in what she thought was a coffee house, only to be sold to a brothel outside Camp Stanley"""".

Same as Japanese Imperialists before them. They both documents how the Korean and American governments were involved, how Korean officials portrayed the women as “personal ambassadors” fulling their patriotic duty to nation by sexually servicing soldiers. The rape and murder of women by the pimps and the soldiers.

It says. """"Drawing upon interviews and testimonies, emphasize that many of the women who """"serve"""" the US military as so-called voluntary sex workers were in fact recruited in the same brutal ways as were their earlier counterparts in Japan's 'comfort system', that is, through coercion, trickery, and even force - because both Korean and American governmental interests have viewed men's access to female bodies for R & R as so crucial to military morale.""""

Thanks!
for the *. NawlinWiki (talk) 

My pleasure. I think I have to apologize for subjecting you to the diatribe it engendered but, as I think you might agree, it tends to prove the point in an ironic way. I just looked at your talk page and decided that the minor whining *I* get from new page patrol is relatively polite compared to what you seem to have attracted  hence the *. Accounting4Taste:talk  
NalinWiki, you deleted my article while I was still writing it on the basis that it contained """"no references whatsoever"""" but allow your own article to stand even though it contains """"no references whatsoever"""". Please, please explain how your point been proven in """"an ironic way"""". Go ahead. Explain it. All I have seen so far from you is reckless deletion of other people`s work followed by pathetic back-slapping from like-minded wreckers. If you are going to have a dig at me, why not do it on my own talk page? You weren`t shy to destroy four hours of my work, so why be shy now? Kont Dracula (talk) 

I think you've confused the two of us; I must take credit for some statements that have apparently offended you, having signed them, so feel free to express yourself here about them. If you want the contents of an article that was deleted, in order to work on adding citations in a """"sandbox"""" page, you can either ask me or another administrator for assistance. If you have any other questions about Wikipedia policies, I'll be happy to direct you to the relevant pages. And if you'd like to work on contributing to Wikipedia in a worthwhile way, in accordance with our policies, I think everyone here will try to assist you. Accounting4Taste:talk  
No, I haven`t confused anything. There is not very much to confuse between you two drones anyway. I see that you are not very good at answering specific questions about specific articles. Evidently, you feel much safer describing deleted articles that you have not even read as """"steaming crap"""" than you are actually discussing the actual merits of said articles. A really positive, worthwhile contribution there. Is that the kind of """"contribution"""" you want me to make? Hardly surprising that you prefer the classic politburo repsonse of """"directing me to the relevant"""" regulations rather than discuss the merits of the case in question. Yet you have the arch hypocrisy to highlight the """"assume good faith"""" legend on your page.

Well I do have some questions about wikipedia policy, as you mention it:

1) Is it an acceptable practice for a wikipedia adminstrator to delete articles which are in the very process of being written without consultation or clarification on the basis that they do not contain references when the very same administrator has himself posted less relevant articles which do not contain references himself?

2) If the answer to the above is yes (and I have to conclude that it is, as that is precisely what has happened) would it be fair to conclude that wikipedia administrators feel themselves above and not subject to the same criteria for notability and verification as non-administrators? After all, my article contained no references and was deleted. NawlinWiki`s contained no references and was amended when I pointed it out. Please refer me to the relevant pages. Kont Dracula (talk) 

1. Yes, to the first part of the question; administrators can delete articles without consultation or clarification. Articles that are being considered for deletion are assessed entirely on their own terms, and not with reference to any other article, so comparison of your article (which I have read) with any article created or edited by anyone else is not a relevant consideration. You can read the relevant policy at WP:WAX. 
Well I didn`t expect you to be so candid about it. So you believe that it is entirely acceptable for an administrator to completely ignore the very regulations that he is so dogmatically enforcing onto others. You still haven`t referred me to the """"relevant"""" page on that one.

But no, you have not """"read"""" my article because it was in the very process of being written when it was deleted. I am sure that there was a great deal of improvement that it required. There were some slightly whimiscial and humourous details which were possibly not appropriate for a wikipedia entry. It wasn`t perfect. You see, that is why I was editing it and indeed still writing it.

Of course, in reality we know that you have not actually expressed your own opinion. You were pretty forward with your opinion the other day though, weren`t you? You described other people`s articles as """"steaming shit"""". Now though, you are not quite so forward with your opinion. Instead, you try to retreat behind """"guidelines"""" """"r",0,0,0,0,0,0

All these MBT's including the Merkava, can fit aboard the C-5 Galaxy and C-17 Globemaster air transports to be airlifted anywhere on the globe. The Merkava Mk 4 has a 1500hp GD833 Diesel Engine and additional armor, especially up top, for urban battlefields. Ever been to the Holy land? You get all types of terrain there, not the stereotypical desert/arabian landscape that is always seen on TV. There are forests and swamps in Israel, and up north the terrain is especially rough and it snows too. What consensus are you talking about? Israel has had more battlefield experience with the use of armor and armored warfare in general than any country on this planet. The weight of the Merkava Mk 4 is approximately the same as the M1A2SEP. It has more crew protection than the Leopard tank and has an active self-defense system. It also retains the 60mm Mortar which can be fired under armor. BATTLEFILED MOBILITY of the Merkava series of tanks is better than both the M1 and the Leopard. It is true that both tanks are faster than the Merkava but the Merkava was designed with emphasis on crew protection, survivability and firepower, over speed. The Merkava is more survivable in a firepower-saturated environment meaning it can go places the M1 and Leopard cannot. For this reason the Merkava has more freedom to maneuver, which gives more options to it's operators and commanders, and allows more aggressive courses of action.

 legends pertaining to Mucalinda 

I have heard and read from several sources a story which elaborates on the Mucalinda legend.  According to this story, the Buddha was pleased with his protector and blessed him by placing a hand on his hood.  As a sign of the Buddha's blessing, cobras bear his fingerprints on their hoods.  Indian or Spectacled cobras (Naja naja) of course have two ocelli or eyespot markings on the back of their hood.  (These are thought to serve as """"eyes in the back of the head,"""" with the adaptive function of deterring predators that might try to attack the standing cobra from behind).  This story may be told in Thailand also, although there is a slight inconsistency in that Thai cobras (Naja kaouthia) have only one spot. )

I have also heard a variant in which the Buddha was protected by the serpent not from rain storms but from the blazing Indian sun.

Unfortunately, I cannot find a decent source for either of these elements in the Mucalinda story and do not know where they originated. 174.111.242.35  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

A similar case existed in Belarus, but much more amplified, when the changes of 1930s and subsequent orthographic reforms were very noticeable it affected the way whole cities were spelled. Example Minsk and Mensk. In fact that is the reason why there are two versions of Belarusian edition wikipedia, one uses the old and the other the official adopted version. In Ukrainian language a similar happened but to lesser extent, and only some cities were affected e.g. Rivne became Rovno, Luhanske became Luhansk, Konotip became Konotop and so on. With our city as far as I am aware it too became Мукачево. During the 1990s some of those changes were reversed, and it really falls to because in Ukrainian there are sufficient differences between dialects, in fact if you compare western and central Ukrainian the differences would be more vivid than that of British and American English. So for some cases like Rivne, it was much up to the locals, because Volhynian dialect pronounces the city like its spelled, whilst somewhere in Poltava they will say it as Rovno. It seems that with Mukhachevo it is a case that the version used by locals is not entirely adopted nationwide. But then again there are some silly people in the government who use spellings such as Sevatopil but that is outright stupid, because even in classic orthography that version would never be used. The -pil originates from the connotation of field like Ternopil. The -pol comes from the Greek root for city, like Sevastopol. All the more reasons why we should stick to Mukachevo and help to leave the archaic spelling where it belongs in history.",0,0,0,0,0,0

f4476a1a6bf0a6a9,"""POSTED FROM MARYLAND TALK PAGE WITH ACKNOWLEDGEMENT FROM Thisisbossi

I'm getting the sense of a double standard for Maryland here. Why is Maryland the focus of this brigade when other state intros are equivalent? I’ve avoided posting in these discussions because it seems you guys are reluctant to seeing the truth and now I have to write a book to get my point across. Even still you will believe what you want to because of personal preference or you don’t “feel it belongs”. Most of all I’m sure you could care less about the state itself otherwise you wouldn’t object. But you want an answer so here it is...

If you think the intro to the Maryland page needs a rework then you have your work cut out for you because you’re going to have to change just about every other state. Case in point, this is the last paragraph from the Commonwealth of Virginia intro, 

 """"Virginia is known as the """"Mother of Presidents"""", because it is the birthplace of eight U.S. presidents (George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, James Monroe, William Henry Harrison, John Tyler, Zachary Taylor, and Woodrow Wilson), more than any other state. Most of the United States' early presidents were from the state. Virginia has also been known as the """"Mother of States"""", because portions of the original Colony subsequently became Kentucky, Indiana, Illinois, and West Virginia as well as some portions of Ohio.""""

How is that anymore relevant than proclaiming """"Maryland donated the land for Washington, D.C.""""? Doesn't talk about presidents from decades past and ceding portions of land belong in the History section according to you?

Not convinced? Here’s part of the intro from the State of Wisconsin, this should put your economic fears to rest,

Wisconsin's rural economy was originally based farming (especially dairy), mining, and lumbering. In the 20th century tourism became important, and many people living on former farms commuted to jobs elsewhere. Large-scale industrialization began in the late 19th century in the southeast of the state, with the city of Milwaukee as its major center. In recent decades, service industries, especially medicine and education, have become dominant. Wisconsin's landscape, largely shaped by the Wisconsin glaciation of the last Ice Age, makes the state popular for both tourism and many forms of outdoor recreation.

In previous version they were proclaiming fur trade!!! But it's a sin to proclaim the life sciences which has become the foremost important industry in Maryland right now?

Didn’t get the message? Try the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,

During the 19th century, Massachusetts transformed itself from a mainly agricultural economy to a manufacturing one, making use of its many rivers for power to operate factories for shoes, furniture, and clothing. Its economy declined in the early twentieth century when industry moved south in search of cheaper labor. A revitalization came in the 1970s when, nourished by the graduates of the area's many elite institutions of higher education, the Boston suburbs (particularly those around Route 128) became home to dozens of high-technology companies. Massachusetts' colleges and universities, as well as its technology sectors, continue to thrive.

The state is also considered a haven for progressive, liberal thought and often sends political candidates to the national scene, however, the four most recent presidential aspirants, Ted Kennedy, Michael Dukakis, Paul Tsongas, and John Kerry, were all unsuccessful. . Massachusetts was the home state of US Presidents John Adams, John Quincy Adams, Calvin Coolidge, and John F. Kennedy, and the birth state of George H. W. Bush.
As of 2006, Massachusetts is the only state in the union to legalize marriage of gay and lesbian couples.

Must I continue? It should be clear by now.

If any1 wishes to discuss the issue in detail, please contact me for an explanation. With regard to """"Shuttegod"""" I am in militant disagreement that the previous text he mangled & reduced in his arrogant edit was """"wordy"""" or """"awkward"""", it was a tight, concise very well written opening to the article explaining in essence what the Anglosphere is. What he reduced it to with his edit - with its bombastic egotistical patronising editing note - was weakly written, mushy, vague & illogical at points. Sorry if that's a bit tuff, but it's the truth. The Anglosphere is an increasingly important concept geo-strategically & it's important to get this source for the term right for those who search via Google for an explanation of it. I am open to edits, but they need to augment & improve the opening text, not reduce & state things that are not true, such as """"Eire being a part of the Anglosphere"""" - any1 with the slightest comprehension of the history of Ireland since 1916 can see the fallacy of this view, & whomever holds it does not grasp even the basics of what the Anglosphere actually is!

Plantdrew - Yr edit of the arms programme that militarily links the Anglosphere was useful & interesting, & I left it at 1st, even tho it didn't quite belong in the opening preamble of the article as it was a little too micro & not macro enough for an opening principle description, the reason I edited it out in my scrapping of """"Shuttegod's"""" massacring of the text is that it seemed to be antagonizing him, & it was out of place a little in the opening. Please place in in the body of the text lower down under a """"military links"""" section by all means.

Seksen the 10,000 turkish-cypriots who were protesting a few months ago (see this) were not protesting against the world (no country imposed any embargoe on North Cyprus). The protests were aimed at Turkey and the imposed austerity measures and the fact that they want to be independent and manage their own affairs. So effectively they feel they're not independent but under occupation (or if you don't like the word, under the """"control"""" of Turkey).  Back to the issue, the Nicosia article should have the same information/structure as the Cyprus article. In fact the the TRNC (or the occupation for that matter) isn't even mentioned in the Cyprus infobox. That's why North Cyprus exists. We have to be consistent. Otherwise what's the point of having North Nicosia? Lefkoşa Distict should be mentioned there. To me it makes sense for Nicosia to represent the RoC (as it officially does) and North Nicosia to represent the TRNC. You can't have both.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Blocked. 

I was told by the Contact Wikipedia page that one was to either e-mail the administrator who blocked them or contact them on their talk page.

While I do not have an IRC channel, I figured contacting here would be the best way. I am the user currently in charge of the IP address 4.249.108.83, which you blocked. I'm not sure why it was blocked, as I've only used Wikipedia to read entries. The only entry I ever edited was one on Air Force One, and that was to change a mistake of the location of Andrews Air Force Base. As for that edit, it is because I live near the base myself and know the area well. If this is the reason for my banning, then I would say you're two years behind schedule.

I haven't hurt anyone, and I'm not around the Internet nearly enough to edit any pages, so giving myself my own login wouldn't be necessary.

I would appreciate if someone resolved the matter of my blocking, please.

What do the three edits Feb. 24 have to do with the sock puppetry investigation of COI from 2006 and early 2007?  This all seems like a big stretch to formulate a grand conspiracy theory where there isn't any. Editors were aware of the COI back when it happened (years ago) and dealt with it.  The article is edited and watched closely now. 

Are the only recent edits those three attempted additions to the Barack Obama article? Hardly a high crime it seems to me.  What you're really upset about is that someone did an unfavorable (but accurate) story about how all attempts to include any mention of controversies or criticisms in the Obama article were reverted. News flash, many of us have had the exact same experience this editor had. If we block users for editing under """"false pretenses"""" so be it, but lots of editors post on other sites about their experiences here. This hardly seems like some grand scheme to bring Wikipedia to its knees.  

This check user investigation, however, and the AfD certainly look like an overeaction that only adds fuel to the fire. Klein said he asked someone to make the edits to see what would happen. He reported on the experience and those he witnessed of other attempts to edit the page that are easily viewed through the history.  This hardly seems like something worth making a federal case over. The only mischaracterization is yours: """"under false pretenses to incite a block and, through off-wiki agitation, bring disrepute on the project and trigger a major meltdown on the Obama page."""" The fact is the editor in question arranged for an attempt to make a reasonable edit to grotesquely biased article and reported on the experience.  That it's not favorable to Wikipedia is certainly cause for reflection and consideration of how we can improve our handling of issues like this in the future.  I know when something messed up is noted on another site and people here are made aware of it there's usually an effort to fix it.  That happened in this case, but the guardians of the Obama page made sure nothing changed.  So be it. If it upsets and embarasses you as it does me, do something to fix it.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

So  I'm sure you're a really nice guy, but it looks like you're adding the tags not because of the the article needing a cleanup and reorganizing but just because the color scheme of the column boxes are not the color scheme of original boxes and are matching the Roc Nation colors and of the logo.

That is just plain out bias it not my fault that other people do not do this when creating a record label studio album discography, which they can and you have not seen one with a color scheme on them. All I have done is put the 3 basic colors Black, Red and White of Roc Nation on a original Wikipedia column to distinguish it from other record label albums discography and the other names of the artists that are on the article, because the article would grow as those and more artist release more studio albums and mixtapes, which makes it appropriate and not inappropriate as you have stated for you reason of adding cleanup/reorganize tags. Once again all I did is add 3 basic colors to the original columns Black, Red and White which anybody can do on any other record label discographies on Wikipedia, but I may have been the first to do this new color scheme styling of a record label studio album discography that does not mean you just add tags that are not meant to be on a specific article that is formatted, organized and written like any other record label albums discographies on Wikipedia and is fully verified.

 Your POV 

Dear Nlitement,
Unfortunately your point of view is not correct. I won't say it is hypocrisy though, it might be rude... 
I am not, but you are, comparing these two incidents... What I am saying is in these two cases Europian has different standards. I cannot see what is hard for you to see in this? By the way I am not supporting what has happened in some muslim countries. That is wrong too. I do not have double standars...  

 AfD for Firearms (computer game) 

Please consider removing your AfD request for the firearms computer game. It's a highly notable mod: It won PC Gamer's mod of the year, was released on CD from valve, and at one point in time was the #3 most played halflife mod (before DoD came out, and that pushed it back to #4). It's been around for years. I notice from your user page you state you are only 13 years old. Firearms would have been largely before your time. Please see forums.worldatwarmod.com and check the Firearms section for evidence of notability. Thanks.  SWATJester  Ready  Aim  Fire! 

 Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/True Combat: Elite 
As per your comments here, it's obvious you flooded AfD with several mod articles as retaliation for your article being nominated. This is unnacceptable behavior, and if you continue to show such aggression, you may be blocked in the future.  
Call it what you want, the fact is you basically admit to doing it to prove a point in SEVERAL places. Whatever your reasoning for it is, the plain fact is that its against wikipedia policy, no matter how you sugercoat it.  
 Hi 
I would like to ask one person who voted on True Combat: Elite deleting. Do you even play games? Have you even heard about the mod? Have you checked anything about it? Have you seen my phat and big comment where I mentioned a lot of obvious reasons for notability. You don't have to answer. I know the answer.  [talk] 
Since I voted, further evidence of notability has been added so I have changed to a keep vote.  

On the same subject, the article was kept per the afd, but you might want to establish the notability further on the article itself (by including some references to it on notable sites etc.) so that someone else won't just nominate it again in a few weeks. Thanks. -

You are continuing to misrepresent my original objection.  My objection was NOT that 'he didn't respond in 8 hours', or anything like that.  (You portrayed that as my objection, though!).  Instead, I objected that Dodo wasn't addressing MY ACTUAL OBJECTIONS.  Other than his 'driveby deletions', and a template or two, he DIDN'T respond to my complaints.  Not only  did he not address my objections within a day (as you implied my original complaint was), he didn't even EVENTUALLY address my objections!  Irresponsibly, and probably maliciously, you tried to make me look like 'the bad guy' for objecting to Dodo's repeated rapid deletions without waiting for consensus, etc.
Dodo was trying to act on the theory, 'if somebody does ANYTHING even arguably criticizable, I can slap him down repeatedly by deleting his edits, without waiting for any sort of consensus, etc.'  (Evidently, that is your position as well.)  I say, """"No!"""".  Dodo never, in detail, responded to my repeated and DETAILED complaints of his behavior.  Is the reason that 'he is busy'?  Well, if he's SO BUSY, 
why did he have enough time to repeatedly delete my posts?  Doesn't make sense, does it?  The answer is quite simple:  Dodo (and, I suspect, many other self-appointed 'Info-Nazi's' ALWAYS have time to slap down other users (that's EASY, and takes little time!), but they DON'T have enough time to actually defend their own actions when challenged!

What the fuck is your problem. Did you even read what I deleted?

DO you know what the word PLOT means?

Plot does NOT mean talking about the movie's trailer or what genre the movie it is. A plot is a SUMMARY of the movie.

Read what's in the Plot section of """"solaris"""" right now you fucking retard and tell me if it really belongs under the section plot... or any other section. It looks more like trivial facts which are unsupported and should be DELETED as per wiki regulations.
 

Here's an example, dumb fuck, from the solaris wiki page:

""""The film essentially ignores the planet which only serves as an anonymous backdrop, in contrast to Lem's novel which discusses at length the mysterious phenomena on its surface and the futile human attempts to understand them.""""

That is NOT neutrality and has NOTHING to do with the plot.

Jesus FUCKInG CHRIST. Wiki is full of fucking morons.

 Copyright issues 

A lot of this article is directly copied from the Iceland website:

as indicated by the fact that there are still asterisks inserted which do not relate to anything within the article, but rather to notes on the original page. Is it possible that Iceland have approved this copy?  

Almost certainly not. If it was, there'd be some WP:OTRS tag on this page or something else saying that it was legit. As it is I've removed it for its blatancy.  

Name change
It's my understanding that the overall name """"Iceland.co.uk"""" was dropped as a result of the dotcom bubble bursting - the suggestion being that associating a company so totally with t'internet around 2001-2 was stock market poison.
Fair use rationale for Image:Iceland Shop Logo.gif

:Image:Iceland Shop Logo.gif is being used on this article.

In addition to the boilerplate fair use template, you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use.

Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale. Using one of the templates at Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline is an easy way to insure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template. Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page.

If there is other other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on the other images used on this page.

 Iceland International Stores 

I started out on this search knowing, without question, that there was an Iceland supermarket on the road between Mijas costa and Mijas pueblo in the Costa del sol in Spain. While merely """"knowing"""" isn't good enough, it does permit of a longer search and of asking the company about non-UK/Ireland stores.  This is what I was sent by email upon asking the company directly through its website:

I can confirm that Iceland do have a number of franchises overseas. However, we do  not hold this information for these stores here. Please feel free therefore to visit www.overseas.es for further information.

I have fixed the internet address from the preceding paragraph to . Click the """"Store Locater"""" tab and, eventually 4 stores in Spain (notwithstanding the text disclaimer at the top of the page referring only to stores in Tenerife) will appear on a map of Spain.

 From User talk:Jimbo Wales I wonder if you might consider...

I wonder if you might consider simply removing your political/religious/etc.  userboxes and asking others to do the same.  This seems to me to be the best way to quickly and easily end the userbox wars.

Userboxes of a political or, more broadly, polemical, nature are bad for the project.  They are attractive to the wrong kinds of people, and they give visitors the wrong idea of what it means to be a Wikipedian.

I think rather than us having to go through a mass deletion (which is what is likely to happen if the userbox fad doesn't go away), it will be better to simply change the culture, one person at a time.  Will you help me? 

 From WikiEN-l [...]

The current situation with these things being in the main Template namespace, and promoted as if healthy and normal in the Wikipedia namespace, is that they are damaging to our culture.  They are attracting the wrong sort of people, and giving newcomers the wrong idea of what it means to be a Wikipedian.

That's why they need to go.  Not to censor people's self-expression, but to make it clear that as a whole the community considers these things to be divisive and inappropriate. Jimmy Wales (jwales at wikia.com)

Sooner or later, they'll all be in GoogleNews/googlebooks; at the very least , for every building erected or planned before 1920. If we're going to hold to the GNG, we have several choices A.  use an increasingly stringent definition of what we consider RSs for WLOCAL  such as requiring regional sources, but that wont have any effect in large cities  B.  Make a special provision about LOCAL requiring more than RSs, such as RSs showing notability in particular ways  C.  Abandon or supplement GNG in favor of distinct criteria that would exclude such articles, such as hotel rating level.  D.   Use combination articles   E.  Accept the articles, but require substantial content F.  Simply accept the articles . G Use a WikipediaTwo or WikipediaLocal project as a supplement to Wikipedia.    

The GNG was originally adopted as a restrictive measure. This is no longer the case. The increase in easily available reliable web information has killed it's usefulness this way. It is now a rule that will increasingly work the other way around. Many deletionists   try to  elevate it into what they consider a basic policy on principles that are not specifically exclusionary, but rely on confusion of WP:N with WP:V ; many deletionists and others think that in principle it is the only logically  defensible way of having a guideline I wonder whether they will stick with it when it yields the opposite result to what they really want, or yield a result that contradicts their own intuition?

What I really want in G, above, a supplement that will maintain WP:V and WP:NPOV and other foundation principles, but not have a WP:N barrier. The inclusionists will be able to get in essentially everything, the deletionists will be able to remove a good bit of borderline content from the present Wikipedia.

 Armenian Genocide 
Peres' denial of the genocide should be noted in this article, failing to do so makes it more of a hagiography than a biography. His shortcomings must also be mentioned in addition to his feats like winning the noble prize. Do you think it'd fit better in political views? In anycase it must, and will, be mentioned somewhere. How about adding this in his political views segment: 

Peres' foreign policy outlook is markedly realist. For example, to placate Turkey, the only significant Muslim country in the region that is friendly towards Israel, Peres has explicity denied the Armenian genocide, which caused an uproar among genocide scholars.(citation)   

Peres made these statements in 2001, when he was foreign minister. Clearly, he was caving in to Turkish pressure. Israel has very few friends and cannot afford to lose them, so basically it is not free to take the position that would seem to mesh with its outlook and history, which is to recognize that the Armenians were murdered en mass. Now he is president, an honorary position, not a political one, and his """"views,"""" whatever they may have been back then, are worth about as much as mine are. I have no problem with mentioning this """"view"""" in the section on his political outlook, but a separate section on this one utterance gives it undue importance and distorts the picture.

Anons concerns cont'd

On the grav-locked, red dwarf planet:

Note that a planet gravitationally locked to its star will have tidal heating like Io, so it's not as if everything will freeze on the night side. The great advantage of a grav-locked planet is its stability. I think it's fair to say that stability is easier for life to deal with than instability. If you look at the stability of Jupiter's great red spot (400 years and posited to be permanent), weather on a grav-locked planet should be relatively stable, I presume a convection rising at the """"sun pole"""" and falling at the """"dark pole"""", with terrain eddies, of course. Such a planet will have no axial tilt, no day/night cycleI don't even think it can have an eccentric orbit, but I'm unsure. This greatly reduces the complexity of an organism's job: for example a plant doesn't need the night """"mode"""" earth plants need; they would not have to drop leaves for winter. These seem like advantages to me.

Based on the best information I can find on the US Dept. of Energy site (solar information), what plants get on a clear equinox day is about 8 kWH/m^2, peaking at 1 kW/m^2. The vast majority of that power comes in the middle 8 hours, less than 1 kWH/m^2 is in morning and evening. The night is essentially 0 kWH/m^2not absolutely, no, but to the 2 digit accuracy I was using, yes. (Compare visual magnitudes of sun vs. moon.) This varies by latitude and season, of course. Now let's plug this into the supposedly horrible 60-200% variation of a red dwarf. Instead of roughly 1/3 time at 1 kW (yes, it really is close to that), equivalent energy would be all the time at 1/3 kW. Thus, the variation would be 1/5 kW during minimums (=60% of 1/3 kW) and, of course, 200% is 2/3 kW. Thus, ignoring frequency, the red dwarf plant has an easier time. The lower power of red dwarfs just pull the HZ in. Considering Earth shade plants, which live on far less than 1 kW/m^2, the HZ is where the total solar and gravitational energy are right for water.

Organizationally, perhaps the best thing would be to treat Earth-like planets in the main flow of the article: then discuss tidally-locked red dwarf planets, with a note that thinking on the issue is in flux; and note that chemosynthsis biospheres would be possible even around brown dwarfs or outlying moons, like Titan and Europa. Perhaps (keeping original numbers):

1 Suitable star systems

 1.1 Spectral class
 3.1 Binary systems (since all but the closest binaries are ok, put it here)
 1.2 A stable habitable zone

2 Planetary characteristics

 2.1 Mass
 1.3/2.2 Acceptable energy variation (as I hope I showed about, """"low"""" isn't really necessary; include the case of Jovian moons in the HZ)
 1.4 High metallicity (it comes from system formation but it's a planet property)
 2.3 Geochemistry (maybe combine with metallicity?)

3 Alternative biologies
 3.2 Red dwarf systems (tidally locked; low light?)
 NEW Chemosynthesis-based biology.

4 on, no changes.

I should add, this is a really good article. Maybe I'm trying to gild the lily.

 Mistake ? 
I am not a specialist but """"Mars, by contrast, is nearly (or perhaps totally) geologically dead and has lost much of its atmosphere [10]."""" (mass paragraph) seems doubtful to me. I mean, Mars still has volcanoes (Mount Olympus for example) so it sees strange to me that it's geologically dead, but once again I am no specialist.  

Mars does have volcanoes, but as far as I know, they're not really active, so nothing is really """"powering them"""" and geological activity isn't really showing up.   
Luna, Earth's Moon has volcanoes, and it's accepted as geologically dead. The presence of volcanoes doesn't mean ACTIVE volcanoes. 
That's basically what I was trying to say, I guess I just never made it really clear.  

 Picture Size 
Can a larger size by found for the Habitability Zone picture? I'd like to use it as a background, but it won't scale up. 

I downloaded it here:  http://library.thinkquest.org though I can't remember the exact spot on the site. An image search for habitable zone turns it up first thing, but only at 19k...  

Earth's geological activity

At least they have ingredient lists on the bottles, and there are a lot of official documents on those additional ingredients.
But kimchi is a different story. Like I said, I have never seen any packaged/jarred kimchi labeled """"unfermented"""", maybe except for Japanses """"kimuchi"""" which is more like pickled vegetables. And both traditional and contemporary kimchi is fermented. (they are not much different anyway.)

Possible Original Research:
I only skimmed through on these parts, but it seems to me that most of this needs to be cited - either for verification, or simply for the sake of further reading.

1. French people often refer to Metropolitan France as L'Hexagone (The """"Hexagon"""") because of the geometric shape of its territory.

Unless it was a Frenchman or Frenchwoman who added that in, how can we know for certain that they really do? Is this self-made nickname for that region so internationally renowned that it's a surefire fact? Unless one can respond in the affirmative to either question, It needs a citation.

2. There are various theories as to the origin of the name of the Franks. One is that it is derived from the Proto-Germanic word frankon which translates as javelin or lance as the throwing axe of the Franks was known as a francisca.

Another proposed etymology is that in an ancient Germanic language, Frank means free as opposed to slave. This word still exists in French as franc, it is also used as the translation of """"Frank"""" and to name the local money, until the use of the Euro in the 2000s.

However, rather than the ethnic name of the Franks coming from the word frank, it is also probable that the word is derived from the ethnic name of the Franks, the connection being that only the Franks, as the conquering class, had the status of freemen. In German, France is still called Frankreich, which literally means """"Realm of the Franks"""". In order to distinguish from the Frankish Empire of Charlemagne, Modern France is called Frankreich, while the Frankish Realm is called Frankenreich.

Fourth Examination, 17th December, 1455. [Additional statements.] 
The sum of a thousand pounds, or crowns, was given by the King of England for the surrender of the Maid; and an annuity of 300 pounds to the soldier of the Duke of Burgundy who had captured her. 

I was appointed notary in the Trial, together with a certain Guillaume Boisguillaume. 

The copy of the Process was shown to me is the true Copy made. I acknowledge my own and my companion's signatures, and that it is the truth. Two other copies were made. One was given to the Inquisitor, one to the King of England, and one to the Bishop of Beauvais. This Process was made from a certain Minute written in French, by my own hand, which was given up to the Judges, and was afterwards translated from the French into Latin by Monsieur Thomas de Courcelles and myself, in the form in which it now stands, as well and as faithfully as possible, long after the death and execution of Jeanne. As for the Act of Accusation and other parts of the Process, Maitre Thomas de Courcelles had very little to do with these, nor did he greatly interfere with them. 

With regard to the word Nota, written above certain Articles in the Minute, there was, on the first day of the Inquiry, a great tumult in the Chapel of the Castle at Rouen, where, that day, the interrogation was held, so that Jeanne was interrupted at almost every word, while she was speaking of her apparitions: Certain secretaries were there-two or three-of the King of England, who registered, as they chose, her words and depositions, omitting all her defense and all which tended to exonerate her. I complained of this, saying it was irregular, and that I would not be responsible, as clerk, in this matter: and, therefore, on the morrow, the place of meeting was changed and convened in a certain hall of the Castle, near the Great Hall, while two English were placed to keep order. When there were difficulties as to Jeanne's answers, and some said she had not replied as I had written, I wrote Nota at the top, in order that the questions might be repeated and the difficulties removed. Although it is mentioned in the Process that the Judges stated they had received preliminary evidence, I do not remember to have seen or heard of it; but I know that, if it had been produced, it would have been inserted in the Process. 

Jeanne was brought to Rouen and not to Paris, because, as I think, the King of England and the principal people of his Council were there. 

At the beginning of the Process, I was sent for to attend a meeting held at a certain house near the Castle, at which were present the Bishop of Beauvais, the Abbe' of Fecamp, Maitre Nicolas Loyseleur, and many others. The Bishop told me it was necessary that I should serve the King: that they meant to bring a fine case against this said Jeanne, and that I was to recommend another greffier to assist me. I therefore nominated Boisguillaume. 

I met Lohier in the Church, on the day after the Bishop had asked him to give an opinion on the Process, and inquired what he you ght of it. He replied, that the Process was of no value, and could not be maintained, because it was conducted in the Castle and not in a legal court; that it concerned many who were not summoned; that Jeanne had no Counsel: and for many other reasons. He added that, in his opinion, it was their intention to put her to death. 

A certain Maitre Nicolas de Houppeville was summoned to attend the Trial; and was in great danger, because he refused. Maitre Jean Lemaitre, Sub-Inquisitor, delayed as long as possible his attendance at the Trial, and was much vexed at being compelled to attend. 

One day, when Jeanne was being questioned, Jean de Chatillon spoke in her favor, saying that she was not compelled to reply to the question put to her, or to that effect. This much displeased the Bishop of Beauvais and his following, and there was a great tumult at his words. The Bishop ordered him to be quiet, and to let the Judges speak. 

On another occasion, when some one was advising and directing Jeanne on the question of submission to the Church, the Bishop said, """"Hold your tongue, in the devil's name!"""" I do not remember the name of him who was thus spoken to. 

One day, some one, whose name I do not remember, having spoken of Jeanne in a way which did not please the Earl of Stafford, the latter followed him, sword in hand, to some place of sanctuary; and, if they had not told Stafford that that place was sacred, he would have slain him. 

Those who seemed to me most affected [against Jeanne] were Beaupere, Midi, and de Touraine. 

One day, I went with the Bishop of Beauvais and the Earl of Warwick to the prison where Jeanne was, and we found her in irons. It was said that at night she was fastened with iron chains; but I did not see her so fas",0,0,0,0,0,0

I blieve the translation from the press office is very good. For someone who is not German this may not be clear, but the first paragraph states intentions, not facts. In Germany there are still people who physically hurt other people and (very few) state authorities who do not act against this, so I believe using is may be confusing. If you want to do a literal translation, the upper version is closer to the original, while the press office version is closer to the meaning.  

 Diverse errors and unencelopedic context use 

I would like to ask this whole article to be checked through. While most of it seems all right, there are passages that make no sense, lack imporatant information or are plain wrong. Examples: First paragraph of Drafting process is
The outbreak of the racial fanaticism in Germany cost humanity approximately 62 million people, or 2.5% of the world population. About 60% of all casualties were civilians, who died as a result of disease, starvation, genocide (in particular, the Holocaust), massacres; and aerial bombing.
While the numbers may or may not be correct, what is the purpose of this paragraph? The people who died and especially the people who did not die because of the war but because of the Holocaust are very important for the way to Grundgesetz was written. But there is no connection made. The next paragraph does not make reference to this and mentions the necessity to keep history from repeating itself in a much more neutral way. Later on:
Any war could and should be categorised as an """"atrocity"""" but the war that Nazi Germany started brought a scale of atrocity never previously known and the statistics of World War II clearly qualify it, by far, as the most heinous atrocity in all recorded history....
Unverified claim, clearly anti-German. The figures I heard suggest that both Stalin and Mao had a higher death toll than Nazi-Germany. Correct, most of their dead were in their own country, but I do not see how that would make it any better.
...and created thereby in Germany the legal situation within which any association of persons that, by reason of their aims or the behaviour of their members or adherents, seek to undermine or abolish this constitutional order is simply illegal, and which assigns to all Germans the absolute right and duty** to resist any person seeking to undermine or abolish this constitutional order, because this demand makes on the entire German people the memory of the 62 million casualties which brought the outbreak of the racial fanaticism in Hitler’s Germany.
While it is unclear where this text comes from, it does not seem to be a quote. I do not believe that this demand makes on the entire German people the memory of 62 million casualties is something that should be claimed in Wikipedia if it is not a direct or indirect quote of some political, moral or other authority. There is also context missing the the right and duty to resist. Violence by the people is only intended as a last resort and is illegal if there is functional police or military loyal to the consitution to deal with the situation.
Directly below the list with senseless emphasis, there is the claim that the German consitution contains blasphemy. Huh? The preamble contains a direct reference to god, other than that there is a rule that religion and state must not interfere in each others buisiness. I am not seeing any blasphemy there. At that time, Germany was a fairly religious state. To sum it up: I believe there was some editor here that wanted to make modern Germany look bad by applying non neutral wording and some unverified claims. The german version of this article seems much better and (logically) is checked much more often than this one. I suggest either having someone who not only read the whole Grundgesetz, but also has significant political and historical knowlege check this article for further inaccuracies or using the german version, which I believe is often checked by people who know the subject, to check this one through. There should be sources to every claim and despite the atrocities in the third reich, wording should be neutral and the crimes of the Nazis should only be mentioned in a context where it makes sense.

Caucasoid

Is it really necessary to mention that some Uyghurs are fair-skinned and have Caucasoid traits? It sounds a bit like Nazi """"science"""" to me... Luis Rib

Well, they do have such traits. You can phrase it a bit differently if you like.  ]] 02:24, Oct 4, 2004 (UTC)

It wouldn't be necessary if we lived in a world in which race (whether considered a real or constructed category) was irrelevant. Unfortunately, that's not the case. The ethnic characteristics of Uyghurs play an important role in discussions of the relationship between Uyghurs and Han Chinese and thus how """"Chinese"""" Xinjiang is or should be. In order to understand the politics of Uyghur/Chinese relations, it's important to know that these characteristics are commonly discussed.  20:20, 2 February 2006 
(UTC)

Why Caucasoid traits? These traits are probably more Semitic than Caucasoid. 86.166.123.12  

The more we try to parse this issue the thornier it gets. Read the Caucasian race entry in Wikipedia and see if you can find any way to separate Semitic from Caucasoid. The entire concept of race is in dispute, and regardless of how people ordinarily discuss differences, an encyclopedia ought to try to avoid such uninformed hypotheses in its entries. It might be better to describe, for example, a people as having blue eyes and fair skin and lacking the epicanthic fold, as well as being largely Muslim, than to try to categorize them by """"race,"""" and so I'd agree that dropping """"Caucasoid"""" would be smart. After all, much of the European population has at least some Mongolian ancestry, as do Iranians, Turks, Central Asians, and so on - and Uyghurs are certainly included in this distribution regardless of their """"Caucasoid traits."""" And if you go back far enough, I suppose the entire world population has African ancestry. You can see how this can become like an argument about how many angels can dance on the head of a pin, and has no place in an encyclopedia that is trying to be authoritative and factual.

Since August 2010, the underground and aboveground Cheongnyangni stations have been directly transferrable through a transfer passageway, contradicting Peterhansen2032's argument. As a rule of thumb, on transferrable stations on the Seoul Subway, the information is combined into one, even for stations with different names (e.g. Isu Station, Cheonan Station). Rather than having to go through a disambiguation page to access information on one of the stations, it would be much more efficient to integrate it into one page for convenient viewing.

 Retired numbers - Peyton Manning removal 

A user, who I've engaged in conversation on their talk page, removed Peyton Manning from the """"Retired numbers"""" section of the article, on the grounds that it's """"assumed"""" though not """"official.""""  My reasoning as posted on said talk page, was that Jim Irsay, the CEO of the Colts, stated pretty firmly that no player will ever wear the number 18 again (http://www.thephinsider.com/2012/3/7/2853459/peyton-manning-press-conference-transcript-2012-free-agency-nfl).  There need not be an official retirement ceremony, or banner hanging in the rafters for the number to be retired.

I have posted nothing on the article page as this would presumably be a Conflict of Interest, and have made here suggestions of the way in which the book may be used only because requested - my view remains that it should be done by an editor who does not have COI. I think that now we've moved on from the efforts to exclude a source through (wrong) application of the Notability guidelines we're left with Neutrality of Point of View as the main issue. Wikipedia reports what is out there and a decision to exclude entirely from an article an appropriate source which has a view on much that is in the article (as well as topics the article excludes) appears to be a bias. The idea that the only book of lit crit on Beedle the Bard has nothing whatsoever to add to an encyclopaedia article on the topic is incredible. I don't think COIN is central to the issue as it now stands; rather the central issue is NPV. I think there are wider issues which it would be interesting to discuss - for example had my username not been essentially my real name a post on the talk page a year ago saying """"hi guys, this book exists and has something to say about the article"""" would not have generated this negative discussion. I suggest MedCab is a way forward because it can consider all issues, while COIN considers only one issue and probably one which is not central.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Regarding the presence of Beppe Colli, I do not see his notability, and the web magazine Clouds and Clocks is not mentioned elsewhere, by other media sources. When I Google """"clouds and clocks"""", I get a 1965 lecture on rationality by Sir Karl Raimund Popper, and I get a children's book on encopresis, the soiling of pants. Similarly, Beppe Colli does not get mentioned elsewhere. The man and the website are not notable.
Applying the same criteria to Babyblaue Seiten and the German reviewer Achim Breiling, I find that Breiling is a medical researcher who has published papers about genes, proteins and cloning, and has written prog rock reviews for the New Gibraltar Encyclopedia of Music in addition to a bunch of them at Babyblaue. CDBaby lists Babyblaue Seiten as a source, and an article exists about that review site in the German Wikipedia. It looks like Breiling in Babyblaue is somewhat more reliable a source than Colli in Clouds. Although Colli's observations are interesting, I cannot see keeping them. It's too bad, because he is the only reviewer who hinted at the CD having some loudness war characteristics, a step down from the dynamic spaciousness of the LP.

This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a company or corporation, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia.

The primary goal of the case based textbook is to inform doctors of what to do when they are asked to perform different medical operations. The case based textbook only has one chapter on circumcision. Its primary goal is to inform doctors of how to react in the case they are asked to perform a circumcision. It does not give an overview of questions that have been raised about the procedure, and doesn't cover sources of controversy in the medical field (only debates). This makes it unfit to speak for this topic. Maybe it would be better to use it to highlight another statement involving controversies in the medical field.

The second source titled Controversies with one author is ok, as it does go over some medical controversies that exist, notably in consent and the parental role.

I think a better sourcing for this statement """"Ethical and legal questions regarding informed consent and autonomy have been raised over non-therapeutic neonatal circumcision.[8][9]"""" would be one that highlights significant questions from community groups in a specific demographic. If we could get a source that is clearly indicating that these questions are being raised that would be better.

 feedback as requested 

Hey Antonin! I'm only too happy to help out (as much as I can) - having sooooo many problems elsewhere. In fact, completely and utterly stuck and rather despondent about it all. 

First impressions; not yet a balanced article - a lot on the controversies, too little on the magazine and its background; the latter, I think, needs clarification. What was the Czech political-cultural context, and how did this produce the magazine? """"Conservative"""" is too vague - I think readers will benefit from being told more about Czech conservatism. Then there's the magazine itself; who started it (and what were they doing before this?); editorial policy, contributors, transfer of ownership (if any) and whether or not the magazine has changed since its acquisition by the media group. 

Put it this way: certainly in the UK (and probably in the US), an award for growing the best cannabis plant isn't something usually associated with a conservative magazine...  

I'll put this page on my watch-list. I'll be happy to sort out any copy issues, btw. Best regards,   

Thanks for your opinions, Davey. You are right, the article is not balanced. I'm trying to use only sources independent on the magazine itself, and unfortunately the sources deal mainly with controversies. There is an overview of the history of Reflex in the 20th anniversary issue, I'll try to expand the article with that information and answer your questions. Btw, Reflex is sometimes really considered as a conservative magazine; could there be a little difference between the perception of the term in the professional and well-developed Anglo-American journalism and the perception of still """"young"""" independent Czech journalism? Using of this term in the post-communist world is quite complicated, as conservatism defends traditional values and continuity, and the first free post-communist media (including Reflex) had to start building again; to some extent they had to find the values and the interrupted tradition. The provocative cannabis award could be an attempt to test the borders of freedom of speech and to come closer to independent and bold journalism. This is, however, just my vague point of view. We should probably avoid this association on English Wikipedia, as this is a world grown in a completely different tradition and experience. Again, thanks for pointing out the problems. I'll work on it.   

I've attempted to expand and clarify the origins and background of the magazine as recommended.   

Yes, I've been hovering over your shoulder the whole time! Good beefy stuff... d'you reckon you're pretty much done with the content? 'Cos I do, and intend twiddling up the prose some time this weekend. By the way, it's no big deal but are you OK with all those red-links?   

Hi Davey, you won't believe how happy I am seeing that you are still interested! I'm careful with the red links, this project has still gaps in detailed covering of Czech topics. All of the red linked names are notable Czech journalists. See the Czech wiki articles for Jan Šibík, Petr Hájek, Jiří X. Doležal, Tomáš Feřtek, Josef Klíma, Jiří Pehe, Tomáš Baldýnský, Bohumil Pečinka, Miloš Čermák, Pavlína Wolfová. With the red colour I'm trying to point out that they should have articles also here. Thank you for your help and interest, ask whatever )   

Oh, I know how that one feels. It can be a strange and lonely business indeed. Still, here come the queries:

 Constitution and Editorial continuity: d'you know who owned it in the first place? Was it a one-man show which employed Petr Hájek? Or was he owner and editor? Sorry to be picky here, but it'll matter, particularly as this is living persons biog.
 Yes, the BLP issue is the main reason why I asked for your help. Hájek was the owner, together with Andrej Šťastný and Jiří Fleyberk. He seems to be the most important one, according to my sources.
OK: so the sale of the magazine (over the heads of the editorial board) was entirely legal, despite the resentment. D'you think this was seen as a matter of personal gain and freedom of action (on his part) vs personal responsibility",0,0,0,0,0,0

 News suppressed on Wikipedia http://rexcurry.net/wikipedialies.html 

RexCurry.net is the historian who made the following discoveries covered elsewhere and on Wikipedia:

1. The USA’s first Pledge used a straight-arm salute and it was the origin of the salute of the monstrous National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazis).  It was not an ancient Roman salute.  http://rexcurry.net/pledgesalute.html

2. The Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched outward toward the flag. Historic photographs are at http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html and at http://rexcurry.net/pledge_military.html   Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute is an extended military salute. http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-pledge.html

3. The Pledge’s creator was a self-proclaimed socialist in the nationalism movement in the USA and his dogma influenced socialists in Germany, and his Pledge was the origin of their salute. """"Nazi"""" means """"National Socialist German Workers' Party."""" A mnemonic device is the swastika (Hakenkreuz in German).  Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent """"S"""" letters for their """"socialism.""""  Hitler altered his own signature to use the same stylized """"S"""" letter for """"socialist.""""
http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html

The Pledge is part of the USA’s growing police-state.  The insane government in the U.S. could cause comatose persons to Pledge dis-allegiance, desecrate the flag, and recite a declaration of independence. Remove the Pledge from the flag, remove flags from schools, remove schools from government.

As a libertarian lawyer, Rex Curry provides pro bono services nationwide in schools and elsewhere, to educate the public about the news.

Government schools will never teach children about their Pledge rights, nor the truth about the Pledge and its author.

Most comments fail to ever mention that Francis Bellamy and his cousin Edward Bellamy were National Socialists in the USA, wrote for and supported their """"Nationalist"""" and """"New Nation"""" magazines, the """"Nationalist Educational Association"""" and pushed their totalitarian dogma in their """"Nationalism"""" clubs worldwide, including in Germany, and that the bible of their movement, Edward Bellamy's book """"Looking Backward"""" was translated into every major language including the languages of those countries that became home to totalitarian socialism and the socialist Wholecaust (of which the Holocaust was a part) under the National Socialist German Workers' Party (21 million dead), the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (62 million dead), and the Peoples' Republic of China (35 million dead).  It is easy to see why anyone would want to cover all of that up, but it should not be covered up.

In the USA, the Bellamy dogma supported a government takeover of education.  The government's schools imposed segregation by law and taught racism as official policy.  The USA's behavior was an example for three decades before the Nazis. As under Nazism, the Jehovah's Witnesses, and blacks and the Jewish and others in the USA attended government schools that dictated segregation, taught racism, and persecuted children who refused to perform the straight-arm salute and robotically chant the Pledge. Some kids were expelled from government schools and had to use the many better alternatives.  There were acts of violence. When Jesse Owens competed in the 1936 Olympics in Germany, his neighbors attended segregated government schools where they saluted the flag with the Nazi salute.  The U.S. practice of official racism even outlasted the horrid party.  And the schools and the Pledge still exist. The Pledge is still the most visible sign of the USA's growing police state.  

After segregation in government's schools ended, the Bellamy legacy caused more police-state racism of forced busing that destroyed communities and neighborhoods and deepened hostilities.

Bellamy was a self-proclaimed national socialist in the USA, with the """"Nationalist"""" magazine, and he preached what he called """"military socialism.""""  The federal flag darkens schools because Bellamy wanted government to take over all schools and to eliminate all of the better alternatives.  Worse, Bellamy wanted the government to take over everything, not just schools. He wanted the government to impose the military system on all of society. School flags are a symbol of  nationalization, militarism, and socialism.

The Bellamy dogma was the same dogma that led to the """"Wholecaust"""" (of which the Holocaust was a part): 62 million killed under the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics; 35 million under the Peoples' Republic of China; 21 million under the National Socialist German Workers'",0,0,0,0,0,0

I realy respect your effort and work there, and I don't revert it. I have no desire to get blocked, or to drag you into another blockade. I want to resolve all this disputes with you. As you can see I already changed Template:Politics of Yugoslavia to a neutral, non-image version. These are my proposals to you:

1) If we put in place your version of the list of Yugoslav Prime Ministers, it will remove Drago Marusic as Prime Minister in 1945, between Ivan Subasic and Tito. If you agree to left him on the list, this dispute is over. If we agree about Marusic, we can also agree about the issue """"Kingdom or DF Yugoslavia"""".

2) Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was a complete different state than Serbia and Montenegro. It wasn't like Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes and Kingdom of Yugoslavia, or Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia and Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. In 2003, after the adoption of the Constitutional Charter, whole system of government was changed. Even the position of the Prime Minister was abolished, and merged with the position of the President. Those two countries realy need a separate articles. Also, their armies need a separate articles.

3) Articles President of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and President of Serbia and Montenegro should remain separate. The last President of FRY was Vojislav Kostunica, from 2000 until 2003 when he was replaced by Svetozar Marovic of SCG (2003-2006). Those two offices was very different (President of FRY wasn't both head of state and head of government, like President of SCG). 

4) Prime Minister of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia wasn't """"Prime Minister of Serbia and Montenegro"""", but of FRY. That article should retain its current name.

5) As you can see, yesterday I changed Template:Politics of Yugoslavia to a neutral, non-image version. I hope that you agree with this version.

"""" A bright line exists on edit warring, known as the three-revert rule (3RR).

It continues to seem clear to me that Malke was editing with obsession towards an agenda; his obsession got him in hot water with the admins.  Soon, Wikipedia policy is going to change, as many here know.  I'd welcome some reasonable discussion, and renewed work on the article.   

On closer examination of the history pages of the main article, it appears some of Malke's biased edits, through sheer volume, are still in effect.  I propose going through every edit of his, see exactly what changes of his have survived, and put back all relevant, sourced material.  Once that is effected, we can pick up the chore of dealing with further improvements.   

Having just returned to WP from an extended absence, I am not fully familiar with what has occurred with this article, but cursory skimming of the talk page reminds me of some of the frustrations which led me to leave WP more than a year ago. I recognize Malke's concerns. Material that is added back should strictly follow WP:BLP, ie., it should be directly relevant to Rove, not defamatory, and should be sourced by reliable secondary sources.   

Malke's concerns were one thing, his methods another.  Admins blocked him not only due to his violation of the three edit rule, but because he was deleting paragraphs of properly sourced material, and as the admins noted (to quote directly from Malke's talk page history, since he has since, for obvious reasons, deleted all reference to his blocking):

'''I highly commend the admins, and urge others to support their work. These admins had not been involved here previously; they took firm, direct action on a disruptive editor, Malke, who was judged to be making """"untrue"""" statements regarding his efforts.

Wikipedia is hosted in the US, so US laws on copyright, etc. are enforcable. That's just the way it is, and we need to avoid legal action being taken against the foundation. To be honest, I don't see big differences in behaviour of editors by nationality, so far as nationality is apparent - I suspect that there are just more Americans here than any other nationality, simply due to sizes of populations of English-speakers, so any group of editors is likely to have more Americans than anything else, including the helpful, constructive, thoughtful ones. I think, however, that there are a higher proportion of editors here now than ever before who have little interest in adding and improving content, preferring to delete, argue, try to raise the bar on notability and fair use guidelines to allow more to be deleted, etc., but I don't see this as a wholly US phenomenon.  08:15",0,0,0,0,0,0

fec6961acc20d82e,"I have just followed from your edit exchange on the article Blu-Ray Disc to find the exchange above.  Sadly, you appear to know little about the subject, and to be fair, it has become confusing because much of the terminology has become abused.

First, European Blu-Ray discs are not produced in 24p format.   That is almost exclusively the preserve of the American regions.  Secondly, the Blu-Ray format does not support the proper 1080 progressive high definition formats (1080/50p and 1080/60p (and I include the 59.95p in that).  This is because the data rate is not fast enough for these formats.  The European sourced discs that state 1080p on the packaging are discs produced from film originated material and is one of the abuses of the term progressive.  The term progressive strictly defines a video format where the lines of video information are recorded in strict numerical order, 

1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 ... 1078 - 1079 -1080.  

Alternatively, there is the interlaced format which displays the odd lines ony first (odd field) and then follows them by the even lines (even field). (You probably know this already).

1 - 3 - 5 - 7 ... 1077 - 1079 - 2 - 4 - 6 ... 1078 - 1080

They are actually stored in the digital video frame the other way around due to the digital video format's origins in the NTSC world.  In true video source material, the even field displays a time slice that is 20 milliseconds later than the odd field and the two together give a comlete video frame.  This is also largely true in the Americas, except the even field precedes the odd field by ~16.6 miliiseconds.

There is a largish group of enthusiasts (if that's the right word) who have become somewhat anally retentive over the progressive video formats and who have convinced themselves that progressive is the only way to go.  The reality is that any improvement in the visual perception of the video is marginal at best and certainly not worth the doubling of the required digital data to support it.  But for them, everything has to be progressive.  I shall coin the word 'progressivists' for this discussion.

When film originated material is transferred to video in Europe, the film is run slightly fast by 4% which allows one film frame to occupy both the the odd and even fields of the video frame (known as 2:2 pulldown).  Thus the even field displays a time slice that is 0 milliseconds later than the odd field.  In order to satisfy the progressivists, the Blu-Ray producers state that such material is in 1080p format, but using something called a 'Progressive Segmented Frame' technique (though they don't mention that last bit on the box).  That is: that it is progressive video, but the odd lines have been recorded together and then they are followed by the even lines.  It is really interlaced video, but by the time the display device or the Blu-ray player has de-interlaced the video (it doesn't matter one jot where it actually happens), the result is perceptually indistinguishable from true 1080/25p video (assuming the deinterlacing algorithm works properly).  If watched on a CRT display then, of course, the video will be interlaced as there is no deinterlacing prior to display, but with that number of lines, no one is likely to notice (unless they sit inches away from the screen).  The description 1080p on the box is, technically at least, wrong but percetually the same as 1080/25p video.  The 4% speed up goes completely un-noticed especially these days when the sound is adjusted back to the original pitch - and obviously you hadn't noticed it yourself if you had convinced yourself that you were watching films at the original speed.

Once we cross to the Americas, different problems occur.  Obviously, running the film at 30 frames per second is not an option, so instead, film is converted to video by storing the same film frame on 3 half video frames, followed by storing the next frame on 2 half video frames and then repeating 3 - 2 - 3 - 2.  Thus 4 film frames occupy 5 video frames (the technique is 3:2 pulldown - often wrongly called 2:3 pulldown).  Properly deinterlaced, such material is perfectly watchable and the viewer unlikely to feel anything is wrong.  But the progressivists have decided that it is not the way to watch film material and have even invented faults to justify a move to a progressive format.  I have even seen claims (obviously failing to understand the technique) that movement in the resultant video is uneven in that it jumps 50% further every other jump due to the 3 half fields.  

The result was the 24p format.  The only problem with the 24p format is that if you try to watch it on a CRT display (and A CRT is still unbeatable for contrast and colour reproduction), the result will be unviewable to bad flicker - something that was known as long ag",0,0,0,0,0,0

I worked as a Mechanical Design Engineer for almost 20 years collectively for the following companies; Pratt and Whitney, Williams International, Ford Motor Company, and as a contract engineer for Compuware d/b/a Professional Services at Chrysler Corporation in Auburn Hills, Mi. It is the latter two to which I am forging my complaint as they told prospective employers, my private investigator and my newspaper reporter, that I was not employed by them, thus blacklisting me, and preventing from all future employment.

 

I believe that they did this to me because I found fault with one of Chrysler’s automotive designs that could have resulted in a safety issue, that they did not want to fix and it was easier and cheaper to get rid of me.

 

I took my case all the way to the Supreme Court in Washington, DC and in Boston’s Federal court ….all courts denied me justice. A lawyer representing Chrysler offered me $1000 to settle the case about 2 years ago which I refused since I felt it was like a slap in the face compared to the injustice they have caused me.

 

Your viewing of my video will greatly help to end my 11 yrs of homelessness by increasing public awareness of my case and consequently, will send Chrysler, Compuware and combustion components a direct message that I am not giving up and refuse to go quietly into the night.

 

Thank you for your time and consideration,

 

Bill Butler

Sorry I find that there's nothing """"honorable"""" about samurai ethics, it's largely blind loyalty and fanaticism, and lack any of the Judeo-Christian values such as compassion and mercy. Such are the values indoctrinated into Imperial Japanese soldiers when they slaughtered over 300,000 Chinese civillians in the Nanjing Massacre, tortured Allied POWs in prison camps such as Changi, launched suicide Kamikaze attacks against Allied ships etc. Not even the Germans, who had at least at some Judeo-Christian values left even under the Nazi regime, match the level of fanaticism and pure evil of Imperial Japan.60.242.159.224

I find it telling that neither of you had the courtesy to respond to my proposal and K3 went ahead to begin editing the article without any consensus being reached. Let the record note that I am now compelled to reciprocate your actions and make my suggested changes. JJ obviously lacks any serious knowledge in this area and was only here for circumventing 3RR, so there's no point answering his most recent underinformed questions. I'll focus on Kautilya3. If you were significantly acquainted with the topic, you would understand that the Kakatiyas were feudatories of the Eastern Chalukya dynasty.So the question of when the formal royal dynasty began is a natural question, not """"patent nonsense"""", and probably one of the reasons some previous editor changed the old date to """"Uncertain"""". 1053 was the date given for the first royal inscription based on the permanent grant of Hanumakonda (their original capital for your edification) as a fief to the Kakatiyas. I also suggest you both refresh your knowledge of WP:Civility, to improve the quality of your current and future discussions. If you don't know about an author, here's a hint, ask...politely..rather than first disrespectfully dismissing the author, then demanding his c.v. What's more, his book speaks for itself. Its the History and Culture of Andhra Pradesh (the old state which included the new state of Telangana). This is not some arcane ivory tower speculative paper, but a WP:RS. So if you want to change the date to 956CE, perfectly fine by me. The only difference is, I had the sense of responsibility to provide a citation. I suggest you do the same. 

Let me repeat that I am perfectly fine with having a respectful dialogue. But as I've said before, it takes two hands to clap. Ball is in your court, gentlemen.

 Auto guides and the motoring press are not good sources for an encyclopedia article about """"luxury vehicle"""". This is because automakers feed the press a lot of BS (Boastful Superlatives) who then work hard to write articles adding even more BS to describe their products. The press earns credits from the hands that feed them. Add to this the fact that potential and actual purchasers of luxury vehicles have an insatiable  appetite  for this type of BS. Classifying a particular vehicle as """"luxury"""" is also designed to easily make it superior to other vehicles even if the differences are superficial. Using self-serving BS in marketing claims is a very, very old invention that helps sell products, as well as fuel the fan base with """"bragging"""" rights to which vehicles are """"luxury"""". On the other hand, it is more difficult for most marketers to be humble and genuine.
